# Designing with PX Blue

PX Blue is Eaton’s Open-Source Design system for digital experiences. The design system consists of digital brand guidance, logo usage, color usage, typography guidance, iconography and more! We have tools and resources for designers working on web and mobile experiences and are continuing to build out the design system with the help of the open source community! 

The PX Blue design kit contains Figma libraries containing components and patterns that are within the design system. Any individual is welcome to view the components in the library via read-access.

Eaton employees and contractors may request access to join specific Eaton project teams with Figma.

## EATON Employee Onboarding

For designers working on Eaton projects use the following steps:

1. Create a Figma account

2. Install the Figma Desktop App or login to the web browser

3. Join an "Open" team or ask a team admin to add you to a project

4. The PX Blue Sticker sheet will be available to you once you join a project team within Figma

5. [Review great examples]() of PX Blue on mobile and web experiences

6. [Review the intro presentation]() (This will take about 30 min)

7. Start designing!

For designers working on non-Eaton projects use the following steps:

1. Create a Figma account

2. Install the Figma Desktop App or login to the web browser

3. **Coming soon:** Install the [PX Blue Community File]()

## Reviews and Innersourcing

We encourage everyone to provide feedback, new design concepts, new patterns, suggestions, or other ideas to help us create the most useful design system to our community. If you would like to contribute back, please reach out to pxblue@eaton.com!

We are always willing to experiment with new components and patterns within the design system. In order to ensure the quality standards for the system to remain high and avoid duplicate patterns that may exist, each new submission will be carefully considered by the PX Blue governance team.

Once a design is contributed into the system, the corresponding code component or pattern will be added to the development backlog. Upon completion of the development code, this new pattern will be published as a new feature within the design system.

## Platform guidance

As with any good design, starting with mobile is recommended. Everything stems from knowing your users, understanding their goals, skills , preferences and tendencies. Once you understand your user consider the following when designing your interface.

## Web Applications

Keep the interface simple. Avoid unnecessary elements and ensure the language used on labels and in messaging is clear.

Create consistency and use predefined PX Blue UI elements. By using these elements, users will feel more comfortable and will be able to get things done quickly. That paired with creating patterns in language, layout and design throughout the application will help with consistency.

Be purposeful in page layout. Consider space and the relationship between items on the page. Structure pages based on importance.
<!--image-->

Use the typography guidelines to create hierarchy and clarity. Using the recommendations for the font sizes arrange text to help increase scalability, legibility and readability.
<!--image-->

Ensure that the application communicates feedback. Always inform users of location, actions, changes in state or errors. PX Blue has various UI elements to assist with the communication of status.
<!--image-->

Consider using defaults. With careful planning around the anticipated goals of your application you can create default that reduce the burden on the users.

## Mobile Applications

Interfaces less than 7 inches in width should be treated as a mobile/phone device. Font styles and layout should be aligned across these devices as much as possible. For stand alone products it is important to consider leveraging native platform capabilities first and foremost.
<!--image-->

A fundamental design principle for mobile design is to include only necessary information. Do not overload the user with more information than they need to know or take action on. Mobile devices are a convenient way to consume information on the go and the information presented should reflect this.
<!--image-->

Interfaces greater than 7 inches width should be treated as a tablet device. Font styles and layout should be aligned across these devices as much as possible. However, they do not need to align exactly as a mobile device.
<!--image-->

Tablet designs should look and feel like a desktop application or website but they should function like a phone app.
<!--image-->

As Eaton continues to grow it is important to consider scaling for the future or additional design interfaces. Products such as non-mobile touch screens, interactive displays, automotive displays and touch screen laptops should be considered.

## Legacy and Product Interfaces

Utilizing the design system without breaking links and symbols will help you stay up-to-date with the latest changes made at the “master level”. You will be able to pull down changes made to the base level components which will propagate throughout your design file by keeping the links in tact.

If you're using an older version of PX Blue, you can pull down the new changes when you're ready.
