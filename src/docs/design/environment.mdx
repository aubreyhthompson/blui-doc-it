# Setting up Your Design Environment

## Software recommendations

While our design guide applies to everyone using any platforms, and we are more than happy to review projects built on any major design platforms (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, inVision), we currently only actively host and maintain our design assets via Figma.

### Getting Figma

Figma is a powerful prototyping tool that facilitates team collaborations and design assets sharing. It works on both Mac and PC. You may [sign up here](https://www.figma.com/).

### Design Assets Stickersheet

Most of the PX Blue's design assets and pre-built styles, including components, icons, colors, layouts, are published and actively maintained [via a shared Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/file/852558784352181868). You are encouraged to duplicated this file to your own draft space and build your own project on top of it.

## Hardware recommendations

There are no software limitations other than the fact that Sketch only works on a Mac.
