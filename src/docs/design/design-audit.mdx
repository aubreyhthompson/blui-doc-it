# UI Design Audits

A design audit is a great way to ensure that your user interface design meets Brightlayer UI’s design standard and lines up with other Brightlayer UI-based applications. This process examines not only branding elements, but also the usability of products.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Banner]}
    regularWidth
    caption={'A typical UI audit will highlight problems and provide design recommendations.'}
/>

Do not wait until product releases look for design audits. Design audits are not just about the cosmetic alignments, but focused more on the usability side, especially when the product team does not have a professional UI/UX designer. Design audits themselves can take weeks, depending on the scope, and development effort the user interface can take months to address the critical / major issues identified.

This guide is written for both audit requesters (“teams”) and auditors to serve as guidance for how design audits should be conducted around the Brightlayer UI design system.

# Prepare for an Audit

## Update Packages

Brightlayer UI sometimes makes style updates to components and themes through our NPM packages. Cosmetic issues such as Material component styling can be easily addressed by updating software packages to the latest versions. Therefore, when possible, teams are encouraged to update their Brightlayer UI packages and other major packages to the latest version.

Please refer to our [developer resources page](/resources/developer) to learn about our latest package versions.

Custom component styling is discouraged, because the Brightlayer UI’s theme may be suppressed. If the team identifies any styling that should be included as part of the Brightlayer UI component theme, please contact us.

## Read Through Our Website

Please read through our [style guides](/style) and (design pattern guidelines)[/patterns]. Many examples cited by the webpage came from design audits we did in the past and are representative of common mistakes we observed across multiple projects. Team members may be able to identify low-hanging fruits during this self-audit and address these problems ahead of the audit.

## Address Comments from Previous Audits

If the team has received audit comments in the past, team members should address these audit comments first before requesting a new one. In case audit comments cannot be addressed due to time / technical constraints, the team should inform their auditors about this.

# Request for a Design Audit

Ideally, a design audit is conducted periodically by someone outside the product team. Team members may [request](/community/contactus) a design audit from the Brightlayer UI team.

## Give a Demo

Team members are expected to walk their auditors through the application to help them understand the big picture. This includes all major workflows of the application.

## Grant Auditors Direct Access

Whenever possible, teams are encouraged to create a safe environment for the auditor to test the project directly. This is to help the auditor explore user interactions and different workflow branches.

## Communicate with User Journey

User experience design is centered around users. Instead of talking about the technical nature of your infrastructure, teams should explain to auditors in terms of user journeys. Who will be using the application? What do they care about the most? How will the application solve this user’s problem?

## Communicate the Limit

If the product has been around for a long time, the team should mention to its auditor any legacy issues. Auditors should also be informed of other limitations, such as limited ethernet connection speed, mobile app-exclusive features, etc.

## Define a Proper Scope

One reason we recommend doing design audits periodically is so that product teams do not work alone for too long before they receive any external feedback. This also helps keep the audit scope focused on a few workflows or screens at a time.

If the product is complex or has never been audited, consider arranging only a few key workflows or screens to be audited. A large scope will “dilute” auditors’ attention and tend to contain a lot of repetitive comments. The team shall select the part of the product most important to its users, or that can help teams learn the most from it.

# Issue Severity

Design audits identify issues of different severities. Severity ratings are determined by their impact on the users. Brightlayer UI recommend using the following severity rating.

A **top severity** issue is a design flaw that prevents a user from completing a certain task.

<ImageGrid images={[TopSeverity]} regularWidth />

A **high severity** issue greatly confuses or blocks its users, although eventually they might learn to tolerate it.

<ImageGrid images={[HighSeverity]} regularWidth />

A **medium severity** issue makes users hesitate, but they are usually still able to complete their task after some guesswork.

<ImageGrid images={[MediumSeverity]} regularWidth />

A **low severity** issue is cosmetic and does not interfer with functionality or usability.

<ImageGrid images={[LowSeverity]} regularWidth />

In addition, auditors may suggest **features** as well. Features are good-to-have improvements; users often notice them in other Brightlayer UI apps.

<ImageGrid images={[Feature]} regularWidth />

As hinted above, audit notes may also be tagged with whether an issue is about usability or branding. This further helps product teams think about usability systematically.

Auditors are recommended to color code their design audit notes based on severity.

# How to Conduct Design Audits (For Auditors)

## Prepare Deliverables

A full audit done by the Brightlayer UI team typically includes two parts: detailed notes that captures everything, and a presentation slide deck including only items worth discussing.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Banner, Slides]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `The detailed audit notes.`,
        `The presentation helps foster in-depth discussions around a given topic.`,
    ]}
/>

Auditors are expected to build up detailed audit notes as they go through each screen. Once auditors are finished, they may consider selecting a few educational or discussion-worthy topics and adding them to a separate PowerPoint slide.

## Apply Brightlayer UI’s Standard

<ImageGrid
    images={[DoDont]}
    captionsUnderImages={[`You can find these color-coded design standards across Brightlayer UI's design guidelines.`]}
/>

There are two parts to Brightlayer UI’s design guidelines — [style guide](/style) and [design patterns](/patterns). Each of these describes a set of design standards, which are categorized as follows:

<RuleTable />

User interfaces must be judged under these criteria during design audits.

In addition, auditors may also employ [Heuristic Evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/) to check UI designs comprehensively.

## Educate the Team

To help teams develop a human-centered mindset, in addition to pointing out the issues, auditors must also seek to educate their product team to think like designers.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Educational1, Educational2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `AVOID: Avoid giving the team an instruction without explaining the rationale behind it.`,
        `DO: Teach the team how this design decision is made.`,
    ]}
/>

For larger products, instead of trying to cover everything in superficial detail, auditors may select 2-3 key interactions and examine it in depth. The auditors’ mission should not be to point out every single UI mistake in this case, as there are likely going to be follow-up UI audits in the future, but to teach the team how to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

## Prototype Key Features

If time permits, auditors may select a few key features and prototype their design recommendation. This has a few advantages.

1. Auditors understand better why the product team designed a feature in a certain way.
2. Auditors get a good design exercise.
3. A new design placed next to its original design serves as a good side-by-side comparison.

## Summarize Takeaways

Auditors are encouraged to provide an overall summary of their audit findings. This provides teams quick takeaways that helps them estimate their effort in improving the UI design.

## Presentation

Auditors may tune their presentation depending on who they will be presenting to. For example, if the audiences possess a more technical background, consider explaining the styling in CSS notations; if they are more on the product design side, consider showing your raw design process and inviting them for a design critique.

Some team members might be daunted by the auditor’s authority in design; however, they have been with the project way longer than the auditor and likely know some legacy or technical reasons for why things are done in a certain way. Auditors should encourage teams to challenge the design audit result to foster a better discussion.

Auditors need to remember to pause from time to time in their presentations for the audiences to catch up — likely not many people in the audience are used to thinking the way a UI designer thinks. Auditors should also ask one of the audience to take notes.
Recommend Next Steps
Before the end of their presentations, auditors should recommend the next steps for teams to act upon. If the auditor has a technical background, they may list a few items as easy-to-fix quick-win items for the developer. If there are major feature suggestions, the auditor may picture how they will fit into the product’s big picture, and what the R&D timeline would look like.

## Improve Brightlayer UI

During the audit, if auditors noticed anything worth componentizing, or that the existing Brightlayer UI standard is too strict, please suggest it to us. Many design guidelines in Brightlayer UI today came from real project design audits we did.

# Understand Audit Results

## Prioritize Issues

Teams must prioritize high-severity issues as they are blocking the application’s functions. These issues must be addressed before the next major release. Meanwhile, mid-severity issues can wait until the next major release, but should still be groomed into the backlog. Low-severity issues are typically considered technical debt.
High-frequency issues — issues that may not be severe but are exposed to users — should also be prioritized.

## Do Not Skip User Testing

A design audit is not meant to replace user testing. While auditors can flag potential issues based on purely their experience in the design industry, they are not the end user. Teams should conduct user testing to drive major changes while using design audit as a supplemental tool.

## Schedule Next Audit

Typically, one design audit is enough to cover most issues in the current version of the user interface. Product teams may consider reaching out to another designer after the existing issues have been pointed out.

Whenever there are major changes to the user interface, product teams should conduct a new design audit to ensure they are still on track.
