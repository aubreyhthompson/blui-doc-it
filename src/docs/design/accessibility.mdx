# Accessibility

As EATON’s digital presence continues to grow worldwide it is important to ensure that your projects meet baseline accessibility standards. With this in mind PX Blue has made the conscious decision to ensure that all components were checked and meet Level AA compliance standards.

For international products it is important to research what level of compliance is required by law. They can vary from country to country.

Accessibility guidelines assist in ensuring that people with disabilities can access and view your products without issues. The best practice guidelines used internationally on making websites accessible to people with disabilities are the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG) 2.0, released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2008.

## Four Principles Of Accessibility (w3.org)

Success criteria is organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content.

1. Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Meaning that users must be able to perceive the information being presented and that information is not hidden. For example, a button should look like a button and not hidden behind an image or other hard to distinguish elements.

2. Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable. Meaning that the interface cannot require interactions that a user cannot perform.

3. Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. This means that users must be able to consume the information easily as well as operate the user interface with ease. The content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding. It is this reason why PX Blue defaults to labels accompanying buttons in the main navigation menu.

4. Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users including assistive technologies. This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance.

## Color

Sticking with PX Blue default styles will help ease any concerns about your project colors passing accessibility. If your project requires the use of secondary colors the following guidelines apply. It is recommended to stick around the 500+ range of each color to meet the accessibility standards (for white background designs). The 500 colors have been tested to meet the baseline. However, it is also recommended to avoid using yellow, red and orange hues for text colors. The exception is simple one line caption lines (error message).

Ensure that there is high contrast between the color of the text presented and the background. Ensure that the color is not the only prompt used to convey information (for example: do not say select the red circle to continue

How to check. Check your contrast by ensuring that your backgrounds are White 50 or Gray 50 with the text being Black 500. You can also use a free contrast tool (tool link here) to test your contrast.

Reason? Low contrast (grey 500 on white 50) makes it difficult for all users to view your product and more so for people with sight impairment. Using color to convey information is inappropriate for people with color-related visuals.

## Text

When applying accessible colors to text also ensure that it can be made larger without affecting the content or function of the page or site. PX Blue default spacing helps alleviate these concerns by providing enough space to allow text to increase in size. It is still recommended to double check all your components to ensure that there are no issues.

In general, PX Blue uses Black 500 for text color. Designs can use alternative colors such as Blue 500 for headlines as well as other secondary colors in the 500 range. Buttons should use the default of White 50 unless the button is in the Yellow/Orange spectrum. In this case the text will need to be in the 800-900 range of that color. For example, a button with a yellow 500 background should use yellow 800-900 as its font color.

How to check. Check that your text can be made larger and smaller and that the page continues to make sense in your browser. You can do this by selecting “view” followed by “text size” set to “largest” in the browser window.

Reason? People with low visibility need to increase the text size of pages to view the information.

## Images

Ensure that any images have descriptive text unless they are purely for decoration. It is recommended for decorative images to have a brief description to be displayed on hover. Follow the text writing guidelines found HERE on the doc it website.

Best Practices For Accessible Content

1. Do not rely on color as a navigational tool or as the sole way to differentiate items

2. Images should include descriptive text/Alt text in the markup/code. Complex images should have more extensive descriptions near the image. (PX Blue uses captions and descriptive summaries built into the neighboring paragraph)

3. Functionality should be accessible through mouse, keyboard and touch. Also consider functionality to be tagged to work with voice-control systems

4. Content should have a “Skip Navigation” feature (when it applies)

5. Videos must provide visual access to the audio information through in-sync captioning

6. Consider 508 section testing

## Testing Tools For Web

The tools used in the Trusted Tester Test Process (and ICT Testing Baseline) have been chosen based on several factors including ease of use, ease of teaching, and accuracy of results. They are also free to install and use.

-   Color Contrast Analyzer for [Mac](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-OSX/releases/tag/2.4) and [Windows](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-Win/releases/tag/2.5.0) (CCA)
