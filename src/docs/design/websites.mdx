# Designing for Websites

## Website vs Application

PX Blue focuses primarily on application design and development. This leads to the question, what is the difference between web and app design? Applications are ideal for frequent and repeated use. They are used to answer a specific need or preform a specific action. Websites are designed for the purpose of providing information to a large audience or for specific events and promotion to a targeted audience.

> Applications:

-   Designed for interaction with the end user
-   User manipulates data
-   Functionality is complex compared to a website

> Websites:

-   Consists of static content and publicly accessible
-   Provides visual & text content which user can view and read
-   Functionality is less complex compared to web applications

## Create consistent tone

Understand what each page’s purpose is. What is each page trying to accomplish? Where do you want the user to go from the page they’re look at? How does the website interlink with itself?

In particular during the process of website development is to create a clean, appealing design. A quality design is attractive and easy to read with intuitive navigation. Most importantly, a clean design helps the audience focus on the value of the brand and content. Often, the audience will associate a website design with the quality of a particular company or product. A clean design will provide a positive user experience that encourages the audience to return.

It is important to maintain consistent tone throughout the website. Consider your audience when creating content. Keep technical jargon to a minimum. Content should be descriptive and straight to the point.

## Information layout

> need examples

How information is presented on the pages is very important. PX Blue will be recommending the use of a grid system to set up layouts. Grids also make it easier to scale and stack for responsive layouts.

## Simplicity

Website appearance is important however most users aren’t coming to the site to evaluate how the design looks. There is an action or a piece of information that has drawn them to the site.

Avoid unnecessary design elements that will only overwhelm and make it more difficult for users to accomplish what they’re trying to accomplish.

Do not be afraid of white space!

## Colors

Keep colors to a minimum. It is recommended to use a maximum of five different colors in your design. It is also recommended to use the Primary Eaton colors (Blue, Black, Grey, White). In the case of a product catalog or commerce site it is recommended to use some of the products branding color on the individual product pages. These colors should be focused to colored image backgrounds or highlight colors. Example below

## Typefaces

The typefaces you use should be Open Sans. However, if you need to use an alternative font ensure that it is highly legible. Avoid using script fonts. Keep color of text to a minimum and always make sure it contrasts with the background color. It is recommended to use a maximum of three different typefaces and a maximum of three different font sizes. Any questions on fonts can be directed to the PX Blue team.

Keep body copy and label font sizes no smaller than 12 px. This rule is adjustable for callouts, but font should still stay no smaller than 8px. PX Blue provides font styles that follow these guidelines.

While PX Blue does not use a secondary/accent font style, the following are approved by PX Blue to be used for very specific use cases such as quotes or call outs.

## Graphics

Only use graphics if they help the user complete a task, perform a specific function, or showcase a specific product/situation. Custom illustration graphics can be made by the designer or in conjunction with PX Blue.

-   FUTURE: Refer to PX Blue docit site for guidelines on illustration style and creation.

## Visual Hierarchy

Arrange and organize the website elements so the user naturally gravitates toward the most important elements first. The goal is to allow the users to complete a desired action in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. Value proposition or CTA high on the home page. Try adjusting the position, color of certain elements. You can structure your site in such a way that viewers will be drawn to those elements first.

## Navigation

Intuitive navigation on your site is critical to help users find what they are looking for. Users should be able to land on your site and not have to think extensively about where to click next. Navigation throughout the site should be as frictionless as possible.
Keep the structure of your primary navigation simple and at the top of the page.
Include navigation in the footer of the site. If not a full navigation users should be able to access a site tree from the footer.
When dealing with multiple drill down pages consider using breadcrumbs. If you use breadcrumbs create consistency by including them on every page.
Include a search bar near the top of the website.
Do not offer too many navigation options per page.
Do not make users dig too deep for information. When designing your website try making a basic site map of all the pages arranged in a pyramid structure. It is highly recommended to keep your map no more than three levels deep.

## Keep consistency

Along with navigation the overall look and feel of the site should be similar across the sites pages. Backgrounds, colors, typefaces and the tone of writing are all areas where consistency has a positive impact on usability. Not every page should look the same. Try creating layouts for specific types of pages (landing page, information page, product page etc.). Use the layouts consistently throughout your website.

PX Blue has developed several baseline page layouts that you can download here:

## Responsiveness

Self explanatory. As we close in on 50% of all website traffic on mobile and tablet devices it is extremely important to design mobile first.

## Accessibility

Refer to the accessibility guidelines for more detailed information

## Conventionality

A huge challenge when designing is balancing originality with your own creative expectations. Most users are accustomed to specific conventions learned over time.
Placing the main navigation at the top left or side of a page
Placing a log at the top left or center of a page
Making the logo clickable, taking user back to home page
Having links and buttons that change color/appearance when you hover over them
Ensuring image sliders have buttons users can click to manually rotate slides
Using shopping cart icons on a commerce site. The icon also has a number badge that signifies the number of items in the cart.
