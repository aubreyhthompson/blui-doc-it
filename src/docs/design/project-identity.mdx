# Project Identity

While PX Blue serves as a design system for a wide range of applications, it is understood that each project might face its own unique situation. As a designer, you are responsible for maintaining the balance between consistency as a PX Blue application and things unique to your own application.

## PX Blue is Flexible

PX Blue is here to suggest common practice to your project. It is by no means restricting your project to a certain set of design patterns.

PX Blue is built on top of Material Design. A design system stemed from Eaton, an international electric management company, it inherited many design principles from Material Design, while aiming for projects in the electric industries. Since PX Blue is facing a broader designer audience just like Material Design, we cannot just say, "you have to implement your navigation drawer using this design". It is up to the project designer to fill in those gaps.

        `1: A consumer-faced product. End user might be homeowners, small business owners, etc. The project is designed to delight the users.`,
        `2: Industrial product. End user might be asset managers, facility assets managers, etc. The project is designed to  convey a secure and efficient picture for equipment management.`,
    ]}
/>

You are expected to build your own design system local to your project, which inherits the designs from PX Blue, but with some more fingerprints in it that makes your project fit your target audience. You might be designing for a web page instead, where you seek to attract potential customers; your product might be more consumer-facing, and seeks for a more relaxed and friendly communication; or you are designing for an HMI, where the viewport is an embedded digital display on a device, and you need to limit your UI for larger button size and tap-only behaviors.

        `You may tune styles for your application away from the PX Blue baseline style, as part of your local design system. In this example, the app bar (#1), the input form field (#2) and the buttons (#3) are changed.`,
    ]}
/>

In certain situations, it might even be beneficial to explore beyond what PX Blue has to offer, _as long as you have a strong reason for it_ (not just "it looks cooler this way").

## Common Branding Efforts

A few UI elements are commonly used to express a product's brand identity, while still remain consistent with the rest of the PX Blue applications.

Note that, once you've developed a local design system, you need to make sure that your brand identity is consistent. That is, they should be under the same design system for packaging, for your website, for the email formats, and for the digital application itself.

### Theme

PX Blue [offers two themes](/style/themes): Blue theme and Blue Dark theme. Ideally, an application should support both themes, but some applications might be more usable depending on the environment and context of the usage.

By default, we use `#007bc1` as our primary theme color. But this is the baseline color and may vary from projects to projects. You may change the primary theme color, given that you carefully design it to avoid inflicting with the color convention ([see below](#color-convention)).

### Illustrations

<ImageGrid
    images={[IllustrationConsumer, IllustrationIndustrial]}
    caption={[
        `A consumer-oriented product (#1) might use an illustration for empty states, while an industrial product (#2) might use an icon instead.`,
    ]}
/>

[Illustrations](/style/illustrations) are common for [websites](/design/websites) and consumer-faced products. Different image styles can convey different product styles (friendly vs. professional).

### Images

Similiar to illustrations, images are another way to make your applications and websites more consumer-friendly.

**Insert images where we apply background + background images**:

-   App bar
-   Drawer header
-   Drawer header but with user avatar
-   Scorecard header
-   Login

### Icons

We use Material Design's baseline style for [our iconography](/style/iconography).

However, we understand that many projects have their unique situation and the current iconography set may not cover every single use cases; you are welcome to invent your own icons, or harness [Material Design's community icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). However, you should make sure that you have thoroughly scoured through Material Design and PX Blue's existing iconographies first, and that you are strictly following [Material Design's icon design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles).

### Component Variants

**Insert an image showing variations of buttons and text field**

Many components have styling variations, and it is up to the designer to decide which one suits the best for the design context. Some common variations include:

-   Outlined vs. contained (or filled)
-   Flat vs. elevated
-   Squared vs. semi-rounded corner vs. rounded corner

### Verbiage

**Insert a side-by-side image, one saying "Create a new location" and another saying "Excellent! Now let's create a new location for your business."**

Your tone can change based on your application nature too. For websites, you want to be appealing and persvasive. For applications, you want to be concise and accurate.

## Should NEVER Change

Despite all the design freedom you have, there are a few things you should never change. Those either has to do with long-established traditions, or has to do with how PX Blue is established as a branded design system.

### Color Convention

**Insert an image with color misuse on status colors**

PX Blue has [a fixed set of status color palette](/style/color). The status colors are used to indicate the status of certain items. Do not let colors from other parts of your user interface to interfere with them and give your reader wromg impressions on what is being given with what status.

In the rare case, there are certain color conventions in the specific industry you are designing for, like green = off, red = open in case of a breaker. Follow the indutrial convention there.

### Font Family

PX Blue [uses Open Sans and Noto Sans](/style/typography) for all its applications. We [do encourage you to change font weight and font size](/style/typography#customization) sporatically to display a better information hierarchy, but we strongly discourage you using fonts other than Open Sans and Noto Sans, especially any [Serif fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).

### Consistency

You shall make sure your local design system is being carried through consistently. Once you pick a style, you should stick to it, instead of changing it every page.

### Design Conventions

Something are just design conventions. Everyone does that.

Material Design and PX Blue highlight a few things in red. Those are our "do not". You should never include any design patterns like that in your designs.

# Notes from Eric

-   App Logo, using different glyphs and gradients. Note that there is no "Eaton app", emphasize on what that project is.
-   Login screen, background patterns, sutle imagery
-   Drawer header and drawer user menu background, email templates, can try to appy primary / secondary color around (like pp uses orange)
-   Ephesus has magenta e-color
-   Any brand should use the Eaton blue

-   Background related to the indutry, photograph in the extended app bar
-   status color should be consistent, usually override brand theme, so blue should stay a status of "all cleared". Don't let the branding color fight with a status color
-   About page, can do something cool looking (e.g., product team put their signature there)
-   Slash / transition screen...
-   Stick to open sans. On mobile you might have some rare opportunity to go with the system. You might also use the Eaton font but it is not very legible, only use for headlines
-   LIT is some small tweak but is less about branding. Typography: need a reason for typography variations, usually to catch attention / sort out hierarchies
-   Stylization of the logo typography
-   Theme: ideally every app should support both, but need to consider the use cases. Some app is more usable under light mode or dark mode. Designers should do UX research on this.
-   Icons: Eric sometimes use the style of the icon to infer the status. Like filled ones are active / on, and outlined - filled. Recommend stick to baseline and use outlined if needed.
-   Two tones: Mostly the progress icons only. Might only use those at a illustration level
-   Consumer apps: more transition animations, more playful, more colorful, more gradient, etc, but it is bc it is a consumer app
-   Illustrations: Eaton will have to revisit the policy on illustrations. Might need to sync up with Creative CoE on these standards
-   Animation: States between inactive and active, can use some cool transition animations. Success screens
-   Symbols can use some transparency for outlines to stick out from the maps
-   Color convention: if for whatever reason in a certain industry the rules are inverted (green = open, red = closed) then do it. Don't invent something just bc you think it looks cool.
-   Icons should be created only within guidelines, dont invent something crazy...
-   Data viz: Coordination curve?
