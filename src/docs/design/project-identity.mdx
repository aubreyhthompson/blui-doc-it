# Project Identity

While PX Blue serves as a design system for a wide range of applications, it is understood that each project might face its own unique situation. As a designer, you are responsible for maintaining the balance between consistency as a PX Blue application and things unique to your own application.

## PX Blue is Flexible

PX Blue is here to suggest common practice to your project. It is by no means restricting your project to a certain set of design patterns.

PX Blue is built on top of Material Design. A design system stemed from Eaton, an international electric management company, it inherited many design principles from Material Design, while aiming for projects in the electric industries. Since PX Blue is facing a broader designer audience just like Material Design, we cannot just say, "you have to implement your navigation drawer using this design". It is up to the project designer to fill in those gaps.

        `2: Industrial product. End user might be asset managers, facility assets managers, etc. The project is designed to  convey a secure and efficient picture for equipment management.`,
    ]}

You are expected to build your own design system local to your project, which inherits the designs from PX Blue, but with some more fingerprints in it that makes your project fit your target audience. You might be designing for a web page instead, where you seek to attract potential customers; your product might be more consumer-facing, and seeks for a more relaxed and friendly communication; or you are designing for an HMI, where the viewport is an embedded digital display on a device, and you need to limit your UI for larger button size and tap-only behaviors.

    ]}
/>

In certain situations, it might even be beneficial to explore beyond what PX Blue has to offer, _as long as you have a strong reason for it_ (not just "it looks cooler this way").

## Common Branding Efforts

A few UI elements are commonly used to express a product's brand identity, while still remain consistent with the rest of the PX Blue applications.

Note that, once you've developed a local design system, you need to make sure that your brand identity is consistent. That is, they should be under the same design system for packaging, for your website, for the email formats, and for the digital application itself.

### Theme

PX Blue [offers two themes](/style/themes): Blue theme and Blue Dark theme. Ideally, an application should support both themes, but some applications might be more usable depending on the environment and context of the usage.

### Illustrations

<ImageGrid
    images={[IllustrationConsumer, IllustrationIndustrial]}
    caption={[
        `A consumer-oriented product (#1) might use an illustration for empty states, while an industrial product (#2) might use an icon instead.`,
    ]}
/>

[Illustrations](/style/illustrations) are common for [websites](/design/websites) and consumer-faced products. Different image styles can convey different product styles (friendly vs. professional).

### Images

Similiar to illustrations, images are another way to make your applications and websites more consumer-friendly.

**Insert images where we apply background + background images**:

-   App bar
-   Drawer header
-   Drawer header but with user credentials
-   Scorecard header
-   Login

### Icons

We stick to material icon's baseline. If inventing your own or use icons from mdi, ensure that you've searched through the existing MD and PXB icon lib; also ensure that your new icons are following material's icon guidelines.

### Component Variants

Many components have variations, like outlined vs. filled vs. transparency-based.

### Verbiage

Your tone can change based on your application nature too. For websites, you want to be appealing and persvasive. For applications, you want to be concise and accurate.

<!--
-   theme (light or dark). Ideally it should support both, but some app might be more usable under certain themes. Up to the designer to do the research.
-   Typography (Size, weight, etc. Or is this more about hierarchy?)
-   Illustrations, images, Splash screen
-   Animations
-   Icon variations (outlined vs filled vs colored?, square button v border radius v rounded, might be less about that but more about showing status. Can invent your own icons but make sure to follow the icon creation tradition)
-   Use of gradient (for light-related projects)
-   component Elevation (use shadows or outline or transparency)
-   Text tone
-->

## Should NEVER Change

These things should never change in designing a PX Blue application:

-   Branding color for main UI / Themes. Actually you can, but make sure they don't fight with PX Blue's status colors.
-   Color convention
-   Different font family
-   Keep things consistent
-   Things violating long-established design traditions
-   Things we said NO in our design patterns page or on Material Design

Whenever you decide to invent your own style, you need to have a clear reason for it.

# Eric

-   App Logo, using different glyphs and gradients. Note that there is no "Eaton app", emphasize on what that project is.
-   Login screen, background patterns, sutle imagery
-   Drawer header and drawer user menu background, email templates, can try to appy primary / secondary color around (like pp uses orange)
-   Ephesus has magenta e-color
-   Any brand should use the Eaton blue

-   Background related to the indutry, photograph in the extended app bar
-   status color should be consistent, usually override brand theme, so blue should stay a status of "all cleared". Don't let the branding color fight with a status color
-   About page, can do something cool looking (e.g., product team put their signature there)
-   Slash / transition screen...
-   Stick to open sans. On mobile you might have some rare opportunity to go with the system. You might also use the Eaton font but it is not very legible, only use for headlines
-   LIT is some small tweak but is less about branding. Typography: need a reason for typography variations, usually to catch attention / sort out hierarchies
-   Stylization of the logo typography
-   Theme: ideally every app should support both, but need to consider the use cases. Some app is more usable under light mode or dark mode. Designers should do UX research on this.
-   Icons: Eric sometimes use the style of the icon to infer the status. Like filled ones are active / on, and outlined - filled. Recommend stick to baseline and use outlined if needed.
-   Two tones: Mostly the progress icons only. Might only use those at a illustration level
-   Consumer apps: more transition animations, more playful, more colorful, more gradient, etc, but it is bc it is a consumer app
-   Illustrations: Eaton will have to revisit the policy on illustrations. Might need to sync up with Creative CoE on these standards
-   Animation: States between inactive and active, can use some cool transition animations. Success screens
-   Symbols can use some transparency for outlines to stick out from the maps
-   Color convention: if for whatever reason in a certain industry the rules are inverted (green = open, red = closed) then do it. Don't invent something just bc you think it looks cool.
-   Icons should be created only within guidelines, dont invent something crazy...
-   Data viz: Coordination curve?
