# Project Identity

PX Blue provides a foundation for designing and developing applications in a way that makes them feel like they are a part of the same brand. However, the purpose of PX Blue is not to make every application look the same. There is a balance that you must strike between maintaining consistency between applications and establishing a unique brand for each product. PX Blue provides some of the basic elements and patterns to help you build consistency, leaving you more time to focus on what makes your product unique.

## PX Blue is Flexible

PX Blue is not prescriptive â€” just as we build on top of Material Design principles, you too can build on top of PX Blue principles to make your products better for your target audience. There are many gray areas and gaps in PX Blue where you are free to make changes and tweaks.

    caption={[
        `An example of two projects, both designed to control devices, but with different targeted audience.`,
        `1: A consumer-faced product. End user might be homeowners, small business owners, etc. The project is designed to delight the users.`,
        `2: Industrial product. End user might be asset managers, facility assets managers, etc. The project is designed to  convey a secure and efficient picture for equipment management.`,
    ]}
/>

We fully expect you to establish your own local design system for your project that extends PX Blue and adds your own flair / style / identity. Depending on your use case, you may want your design system to be more flashy, visual, relaxed, friendly, etc. Depending on where your application will reside, you may also need to change aspects of the design system related to accessibility (such as larger buttons for touch-screens) or legal-requirements in your target markets.

        `You may tune styles for your application away from the PX Blue baseline style, as part of your local design system. In this example, the app bar (#1), the input form field (#2) and the buttons (#3) are changed.`,
    ]}
/>

While establishing your local product identity, remember that PX Blue is here to help establish consistency, so you do not want to go so far down the road of customization that this is lost. Below, we go into details about some common areas of customization as well as some areas that should be avoided.

## Common Branding Efforts

A few UI elements are commonly used to express a product's brand identity, while still remain consistent with the rest of the PX Blue applications.

Note that, once you've developed a local design system, you need to make sure that your brand identity is consistent. That is, they should be under the same design system for packaging, for your website, for the email formats, and for the digital application itself.

### Theme

PX Blue [offers two themes](/style/themes): Blue theme and Blue Dark theme. Ideally, an application should support both themes, but some applications might be more usable depending on the environment and context of the usage.

By default, we use `#007bc1` as our primary theme color. But this is the baseline color and may vary from projects to projects. You may change the primary theme color, given that you carefully design it to avoid inflicting with the color convention ([see below](#color-convention)).

### Illustrations

<ImageGrid
    images={[IllustrationConsumer, IllustrationIndustrial]}
    caption={[
        `A consumer-oriented product (#1) might use an illustration for empty states, while an industrial product (#2) might use an icon instead.`,
    ]}
/>

[Illustrations](/style/illustrations) are common for [websites](/design/websites) and consumer-faced products. Different image styles can convey different product styles (friendly vs. professional).

### Images

Similiar to illustrations, images are another way to make your applications and websites more consumer-friendly.

<ImageGrid
    images={[ImageAppBar, ImageDrawerRegular, ImageDrawerProfile, ImageScorecardHeader, ImageLogin, ImageSuccess]}
    caption={[
        `There are many opportunities where you can apply background images or tiles to promote your brand identity.`,
        `1: Background image on an extended app bar.`,
        `2: Background tile on a drawer header.`,
        `3: Background tile on a drawer .`,
        `4: Background images on the header of scorecards.`,
        `5: Background tiles on a login screen on the desktop.`,
        `6: Geometric shape on a login card.`,
        `7: Wavy, delightful background pattern for account creation success screen.`,
    ]}
/>

### Icons

We use Material Design's baseline style for [our iconography](/style/iconography).

However, we understand that many projects have their unique situation and the current iconography set may not cover every single use cases; you are welcome to invent your own icons, or harness [Material Design's community icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). However, you should make sure that you have thoroughly scoured through Material Design and PX Blue's existing iconographies first, and that you are strictly following [Material Design's icon design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles).

### Component Variants

<ImageGrid
    images={[VariationButton, VariationTextField]}
    caption={'Buttons and text fields have many style variations.'}
/>

Many components have styling variations, and it is up to the designer to decide which one suits the best for the design context. Some common variations include:

-   Outlined vs. contained (or filled)
-   Flat vs. elevated
-   Squared vs. semi-rounded corner vs. rounded corner

### Verbiage

<ImageGrid
    images={[VerbiageNeutral, VerbiageExcitement]}
    caption={`Depends on the industry of your product, sometimes you want to sound more neutral and professional (#1), while other times you might want to cheer up your user through an (often cumbersome) configuration workflow (#2).`}
/>

Your tone can change based on your application nature too. For websites, you want to be appealing and persvasive. For applications, you want to be concise and accurate.

## Should NEVER Change

Despite all the design freedom you have, there are a few things you should never change. Those either has to do with long-established traditions, or has to do with how PX Blue is established as a branded design system.

### Color Convention

<ImageGrid images={[ListColorCorrect, ListColorIncorrect]} caption={'Do not break color conventions.'} />

PX Blue has [a fixed set of status color palette](/style/color). The status colors are used to indicate the status of certain items. Do not let colors from other parts of your user interface to interfere with them and give your reader wromg impressions on what is being given with what status.

In the rare case, there are certain color conventions in the specific industry you are designing for, like green = close, red = open in case of a breaker. Follow the indutrial convention there.

### Font Family

PX Blue [uses Open Sans and Noto Sans](/style/typography) for all its applications. We [do encourage you to change font weight and font size](/style/typography#customization) sporatically to display a better information hierarchy, but we strongly discourage you using fonts other than Open Sans and Noto Sans, especially any [Serif fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).

### Consistency

You shall make sure your local design system is being carried through consistently. Once you pick a style, you should stick to it, instead of changing it every page.

### Design Conventions

Something are just design conventions. Everyone does that.

Material Design and PX Blue highlight a few things in red. Those are our "do not". You should never include any design patterns like that in your designs.

# Notes from Eric

-   App Logo, using different glyphs and gradients. Note that there is no "Eaton app", emphasize on what that project is.
-   Login screen, background patterns, sutle imagery
-   Drawer header and drawer user menu background, email templates, can try to appy primary / secondary color around (like pp uses orange)
-   Ephesus has magenta e-color
-   Any brand should use the Eaton blue

-   Background related to the indutry, photograph in the extended app bar
-   status color should be consistent, usually override brand theme, so blue should stay a status of "all cleared". Don't let the branding color fight with a status color
-   About page, can do something cool looking (e.g., product team put their signature there)
-   Slash / transition screen...
-   Stick to open sans. On mobile you might have some rare opportunity to go with the system. You might also use the Eaton font but it is not very legible, only use for headlines
-   LIT is some small tweak but is less about branding. Typography: need a reason for typography variations, usually to catch attention / sort out hierarchies
-   Stylization of the logo typography
-   Theme: ideally every app should support both, but need to consider the use cases. Some app is more usable under light mode or dark mode. Designers should do UX research on this.
-   Icons: Eric sometimes use the style of the icon to infer the status. Like filled ones are active / on, and outlined - filled. Recommend stick to baseline and use outlined if needed.
-   Two tones: Mostly the progress icons only. Might only use those at a illustration level
-   Consumer apps: more transition animations, more playful, more colorful, more gradient, etc, but it is bc it is a consumer app
-   Illustrations: Eaton will have to revisit the policy on illustrations. Might need to sync up with Creative CoE on these standards
-   Animation: States between inactive and active, can use some cool transition animations. Success screens
-   Symbols can use some transparency for outlines to stick out from the maps
-   Color convention: if for whatever reason in a certain industry the rules are inverted (green = open, red = closed) then do it. Don't invent something just bc you think it looks cool.
-   Icons should be created only within guidelines, dont invent something crazy...
-   Data viz: Coordination curve?
