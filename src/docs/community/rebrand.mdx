# PX Blue is Rebranding

In Q4 of 2021, we will be rebranding our design system from PX Blue to Brightlayer UI.  This rebranding effort will impact all resources that PX Blue currently provides, including:

- NPM Packages
- Github Repositories
- Figma Stickersheet
- Documentation
- This documentation site & URL

## Steps Required to Update


### For Developers

All [`@pxblue` NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~px-blue) packages will be renamed from `@pxblue/*` to `@brightlayer-ui/*`.

Make sure to update to the latest version of each `@pxblue` package before the rebranding occurs to minimize the amount of work required when updating to `@brightlayer-ui`.

Only the latest **2 major versions** for each `@pxblue` package will be migrated over to using the `@brightlayer-ui` namespace.

The steps required to update will vary between packages.

All of our current `@pxblue` packages will remain on NPM, but they will not longer be supported by the Brightlayer UI team, meaning no additional features will be released with limited support for resolving bugs.
