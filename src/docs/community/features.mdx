## How We Innersource New Features

<ImageGrid
    images={[FourStepsImg]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 8 }}
    caption={'We take four steps to go through a newly proposed idea: evaluate, iterate, implement, and release.'}
/>

The first step after we hear from you is to evaluate the popularity, importance, and feasibility of the proposed idea. How "trendy" is this practice? How many Eaton applications are using it? How many will be using it in the future? Is this a low-hanging fruit or does it require intense attention? Once this is decided, we will get back to you whether or not we can inner source it and, if we do, what the timeline looks like. 

Next, we will gather our designers and developers to iterate for a better PX Blue conformity, if necessary. We would check for colors, components, and layouts to ensure that the proposed idea aligns with our existing patterns. During this iteration process, we might contact you from time to time to exchange ideas. 

We then queue it up for a scheduled quarter release (see our [roadmap](/roadmap) for details). Depends on the demand, we would implement it in the Figma team library (designers), NPM packages, and/or design pattern code examples (developers). 

Finally, we officially release it. For developers, you might be able to use our pre-released beta packages for a preview.
