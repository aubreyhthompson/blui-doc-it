# Getting Started with Angular

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new PX Blue project using Angular. Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/pxblue) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

## Using the PX Blue CLI

The fastest way to start a new PX Blue project is to use the [PX Blue CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using the [Angular CLI](http://cli.angular.io/)) with all of the necessary PX Blue dependencies pre-configured. To start an Angular project:

```sh
npx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new angular
```

You will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the PX Blue eslint and prettier configurations files.

The PX Blue CLI will automatically include:

-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))
-   PX Blue Component Library ([@pxblue/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-components))
-   PX Blue Themes ([@pxblue/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes))
-   PX Blue Icons ([@pxblue/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons))
-   PX Blue Colors ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors))
-   Open Sans web font ([typeface-open-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeface-open-sans))
-   PX Blue ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@pxblue/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/eslint-config) / [@pxblue/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/prettier-config))
-   IE 11 Support

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [PX Blue CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli).

## Using an Existing Project

If you have an existing project and would like to integrate PX Blue, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the PX Blue CLI.

# Manual PX Blue Integration

Before taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the PX Blue CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.

## Including the Component Libraries

### Angular Material

Angular projects should make use of the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) component library. Our PX Blue themes are designed to work with these components.

```sh
npm install --save @angular/material
// or
yarn add @angular/material
```

For detailed documentation about the various components available in Angular Material, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [Angular Material Documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/).

### PX Blue Components

Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-component-library/tree/dev) of components designed specifically for PX Blue applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:

```sh
npm install --save @pxblue/angular-components
// or
yarn add @pxblue/angular-components
```

## Adding PX Blue Themes

By default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [PX Blue theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes), first install it:

```sh
npm install --save @pxblue/angular-themes
// or
yarn add @pxblue/angular-themes
```

Installing the theme package will automatically include the Open Sans web font package as well as the PX Blue [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors) package. In order to use the PX Blue themes and font (Open Sans), you will need to modify your angular.json file "styles" entries (there is one under "build" and one under "test") to include the PX Blue themes and Open Sans reference:

```json
"styles": [
    "src/styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/@pxblue/angular-themes/theme.scss",
    "./node_modules/typeface-open-sans"
],
```

### Applying the Theme

You can apply the theme to your application by adding the proper class to your application's body element:

```html
// Default Theme
<body class="pxb-blue" />

// Dark Theme
<body class="pxb-blue-dark" />
```

> If you do not specify a theme class, your application will use the default Material theme.

You can access the fonts using mat-typography, e.g.:

```html
<section class="mat-typography>
   <h1>H1 Text</h1>
   <h2>H2 Text</h2>
   <p>Paragraph text</p>
   <div class="body-2">Bold body copy</div>
</section>
```

You can access theme colors as well, e.g.:

```html
<mat-toolbar color="primary">My App</mat-toolbar>
```

More details about applying themes in your application can be found in [Theming your Angular Material app](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).

# Additional Information

## Code Formatting / Style

PX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the PX Blue team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/code-standards).

## Browser Support

Angular and Angular Material will work with any modern browser. For specific details, you can view their official support pages:

-   [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support)
-   [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2#browser-and-screen-reader-support)

> As of Angular 8, the Angular CLI no longer includes support for IE11 by default. If you need to support this browser (not recommended), you can configure your project to support it manually ([Contact us](/community/contactus) for assistance) or use the PX Blue CLI to scaffold your project.

## License Information

[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/LICENSE) and [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.
