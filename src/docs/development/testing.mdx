# Testing Your PX Blue Applications

<!-- KEYWORDS: testing test unit e2e tdd bdd integration cypress -->

Testing is a critical component of successfully building and releasing an application. Despite the value and importance of testing, it is common for teams to overlook or neglect it. Testing should be considered from the very beginning of development, not as an afterthought once development is complete. In general, every time you write a new piece of code or update existing code, you should also write a test that verifies that your code is correct.

There are many [varieties of tests](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing), each with their own intended purpose. The most common types of tests are:

-   **Unit Tests**: verify individual methods, functions, or components.
-   **Integration Tests**: verify that different modules or services in your application work together.
-   **Functional Tests**: verify the output of certain actions based on business requirements.
-   **End-to-end (E2E) Tests**: verify that user behaviors / workflows function as expected.
-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that the entire system meets the business requirements.
-   **Performance Tests**: verify that the system behaves correctly under heavy load.
-   **Smoke Tests: quick**: basic checks of the major features of the application.

This document focuses mainly on Unit Tests and E2E tests, as they are the easiest to automate.

# Unit Tests

Unit tests target the smallest pieces of your application (such as verifying inputs and outputs of a class method or function). These will likely make up the bulk of your tests because they are quick to write, easy to automate, and can help you achieve significant code coverage.

> Code Coverage measures the percentage of your code that is verified by your tests.

A unit test shouldn't have any external dependencies, such as other methods or APIs. By keeping unit tests isolated in this manner, it's easy to identify the cause of a failing test an implement a fix quickly. When you start combining features and methods together, you move into the realm of _integration testing_.

## When to Write

As long as you are writing tests and achieving acceptable levels of coverage, the _when_ is not as important.

Some teams elect to follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, where unit tests are written prior to any code. In this situation the tests actually define the desired implementation of the application and the code is written to satisfy the tests.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is similar to TDD in that test cases are written prior to writing any applications code. However, these test cases focus more on the desired behavior (inputs and outputs) of the application, and less on the actual implementation. These are usually written in plain language rather than code.

The most important thing to keep in mind about tests is that they should provide confidence that the code and design are working as intended without issues in any scenario. For most teams, it's fine to write tests after features and functions are developed, so long as you write quality tests and achieve good coverage.

## How to Write

When unit testing components, the most effective tests are based on what is actually rendered on the screen rather than the internal implementation logic. The test should consider the application from the user's perspective and test things the user views and interacts with.

For example, consider testing an Open Button that should open a modal dialog when clicked. Your test should check that a button with the _Open_ label is rendered on the screen, and when it is clicked, the dialog is rendered on the screen with the correct content. You may be tempted to identify the button by a class or id, or test that a particular function is called when the button is pressed - these tests are not as effective because they are more likely to break if the implementation of the component changes, even though the end behavior is the same.

In general:

-   Test what the user sees (i.e., rendered output) and what the user can do (i.e., interactions).
-   If there is visual change after an interaction, test for it.
-   If there is a value returned after an action, test for it.

## Testing Frameworks

Angular, React, and React Native all come with built-in unit testing frameworks. Ionic can be unit tested using the same tools you would use for a standard Angular application.

For consistency, you should stick to using these standard tools unless you have a compelling reason to use an alternative.

### Angular

The Angular CLI comes pre-configured with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for unit testing. When you create a new project, sample tests are created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.spec.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
cd your/project/root
ng test
```

This will build your app and launch the browser with the test runner.

### React

The Create React App CLI is pre-configured with the [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) testing framework. When creating a new project, a sample test is created in your project for you (test files are identified by the `.test.js` or `test.ts` file extension). You can execute the tests by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
cd your/project/root
npm run test
// or
yarn test
```

This will run your tests and show the pass/fail output in the terminal.

There are additional test utilities that complement Jest well. [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) provides access to [React Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) through the `react-dom` dependency. The PX Blue team has also made use of [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), a testing framework created by AirBnB, and [Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html).

### React Native

Like React, the React Native CLI also bundles Jest into your application. Most of the testing strategies and libraries can be shared between the two frameworks. You can also consider additional libraries like [React Native Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react-native).

### Ionic

When creating an Ionic project with Angular, the Angular CLI is used to generate the underlying project, so you have access to all the same testing tools as you would with a regular Angular project.

# End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests at a step above unit tests, both in terms of complexity and what they test. They focus primarily on the flow of the application, making sure that a user's journey through the application has the expected outcomes. These tests can generally be categorized as:

-   **Acceptance Tests**: verify that various features and flows meet the customer expectations.
-   **Regression Tests**: verify that existing functionality is not broken when new features are added.

They should cover user stories that span multiple components and views, such as signing up for an accounts, logging in and out of the application, updating a profile, etc. These tests are not concerned with the underlying state or implementation of the application - just the end results.

End-to-end tests usually run in a browser against a live system (in the case of web, using a test runner that automates the browser). Automated E2E tests can take a long time to run because of all of the different pieces involved and the scope of the tests. You should try to optimize your testing pipeline to run tests in parallel to finish faster.

Functional tests alone will not give you enough test coverage to avoid regressions. Unit tests aim to provide code coverage depth, while functional tests provide coverage over the breadth of user test scenarios.

## How to Write

End-to-end tests rely on the ability to find elements on the screen and interact with them in an automated way. This means that you need a reliable mechanism for selecting elements. Depending on your testing framework, there are different ways to select elements, including:

-   **CSS Selectors**: find elements by using CSS classes or rules (e.g., `.your-class-name`)
-   **Element Selectors**: TODO
-   **xPath Selectors**: TODO
-   **ID Selectors**: TODO

Each of these methods has their own advantages and disadvantages. A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators _without_ property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).

One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `test-id` or `dev-id`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification.

TODO: maybe a very simple example here of an element and how you could select it

```html
<button test-id="login-button" class="default-button">Login</button>
```

## Testing Frameworks

TODO: Consider which of these we want to call out (if any) and give a brief blurb about pros/cons of each.

There are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests. Some of the more popular tools include:

-   Selenium
-   Protractor
-   Cypress
-   WebDriverIO

### Cypress

Cypress is an open source testing framework that boasts support for any modern JavaScript framework. It works well for E2E tests in both Angular and React applications and is easier to use than some of the more traditional tools, such as Selenium.

For a more detailed write-up on Cypress, check out the official [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements).

### Breakable Selectors

In the web application context, there are several ways to find an element and they aren’t all equal and brittle to changes in the UI.

The CSS selector e.g. `.sign-in-btn`
Classes are liable to change, so these are liable to break.

The `:nth-child()` selector. Orderings of elements at the same hierarchical level seems to be subject to error messages from your test runner harder to understand.

The element selector `<mat-icon _ngcontent-c6="" class="mat-icon material-icons" role="img" aria-hidden="true">delete</mat-icon>` is subject to change and becomes an issue if there are several delete buttons on a single page or when the page refreshes.

The xPath selector `/html/body/app/footer/div/button[1]` is also subject change and can become an issue over time as the application UI changes.

The ID selector `#thumbnail` It seems like IDs almost never change, but they can. There may also be other reasons to avoid adding them to elements, such as if the UI framework you are using inserts and relies on them internally.

The `data-test=”some-unique-id”` attribute. This is an attribute added to the target element and gives the test a handle. It can be as descriptive as you want, and the test will be able to find it. It is totally impervious to changes in layout, ID, styles, and even element type.

A common pain point in UI test automation and end-to-end testing is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. The majority of front-end development frameworks auto-generate IDs and classes for components that are used internally, but this can make it difficult to locate elements via test automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (e.g., using IDs, CSS or xPath locators "without" property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is refreshed).

Working with web-driver types of testing frameworks will require additional tools to help identify elements on a page, such as Selenium's page object generator or browser developer tools that assists in writing tests.

### Examples of common elements and finding selectors

For example, identifying a delete button:

1. Selenium page object generator via css:
   @FindBy(css = "app footer.mat-simple-snackbar div button:nth-of-type(1)") @CacheLookup private WebElement delete;
2. Browser developer tools via element:
   <mat-icon _ngcontent-c6="" class="mat-icon material-icons" role="img" aria-hidden="true">delete</mat-icon>
3. Browser developer tools via selector:
   body > app > footer > div > button:nth-child(1) > span > mat-icon
4. Browser developer tools via xPath:
   /html/body/app/footer/div/button[1]

The common example above will require additional work to use in a web-driver type framework automation test. It will require changes to the TypeScript or Javascript code to provide unique IDs (and some Javascript platforms will actually override these with their automatically generated IDs anyway). If you have an existing application, going back and making (potentially) breaking changes (i.e., changing element IDs) to the code is not desirable. With web-driver testing type frameworks, you can simply add a "dev-id" to the element's html and use that ID as the unique identifying characteristic for the selector.
Example:

```html
<div>
    <button mat-icon-button (click)="deleteItems()" dev-id="snackbar-delete-btn">
        <mat-icon>delete</mat-icon>
    </button>
</div>
```

After adding the "dev-id" to the element, the identification of the delete button will never have to change, making it safe even if the underlying component code changes. When you inspect the web element via developer tools you will now see the "dev-id" in the attribute’s property of the element, containing nodeValue="snackbar-delete-btn". This approach is common and now the delete button can be called by its locator and selector via ID, CSS or xPath making it more reliable because it contains a structure-based location with a custom attribute of "dev-id".
Example of the element with dev-id:

```html
<button _ngcontent-c6="" dev-id="snackbar-delete-btn" mat-icon-button="" class="mat-icon-button">
    <span class="mat-button-wrapper">
        <mat-icon _ngcontent-c6="" class="mat-icon material-icons" role="img" aria-hidden="true">delete</mat-icon>
    </span>
    <div
        class="mat-button-ripple mat-ripple mat-button-ripple-round"
        matripple=""
        ng-reflect-centered="true"
        ng-reflect-disabled="false"
        ng-reflect-trigger="[object HTMLButtonElement]"
    ></div>
    <div class="mat-button-focus-overlay"></div>
</button>
```

Example of use in a test

```tsx
getDeleteButton() {return element(by.css('button.mat-icon-button:nth-of-type(1)')).getId(dev-id);})

WebElement click = driver.findelement(by.css('button.mat-icon-button:nth-of-type(1)')).click();

WebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id("snackbar-delete-btn")).click();

WebElement click = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[contains(@dev-id='snackbar-delete-btn')]")).click();

```
