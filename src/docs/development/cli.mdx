# PX Blue CLI

The PX Blue CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool for quickly starting a new project using PX Blue. It will automatically create a skeleton project in your chosen framework, add Material and PX Blue component library dependencies, include and integrate PX Blue themes, typography, and colors, and optionally add PX Blue code formatting and linting profiles.

To start a new project with the CLI:

```sh
npx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new
```

For more detailed information and usage instructions, check out the [@pxblue/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli) package on NPM.

## Supported Frameworks

The PX Blue CLI works with all PX Blue supported frameworks: Angular, React, Ionic, and React Native. For React and React Native projects, you will have the option to create your project in TypeScript or JavaScript.
