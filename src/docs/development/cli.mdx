# PX Blue CLI

The PX Blue CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool for quickly starting new projects using PX Blue configurations.

Angular, React and React Native framework projects will automatically create projects using the PX Blue project templates with options to choose from our list of [Angular](https://github.com/pxblue/angular-cli-templates/blob/dev/README.md#angular-cli-templates), [React](https://github.com/pxblue/react-cli-templates/blob/dev/README.md#react-cli-templates), or [React-Native](https://github.com/pxblue/react-native-cli-templates/blob/dev/README.md#react-native-cli-templates) templates to scaffold your project.

In addition, your project will be configured and ready to run with integrations including:

* PX Blue Components
* PX Blue Themes
* Material
* Typography
* Colors
* Optionally include PX Blue code formatting and linting profiles

Ionic framework projects will automatically create skeleton projects with the integrations above.


To start a new project with the CLI:

```sh
npx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new
```

For more detailed information and usage instructions, check out the [@pxblue/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli) package on NPM.

## Supported Frameworks

The PX Blue CLI works with all PX Blue supported frameworks: Angular, React, Ionic, and React Native. For React and React Native projects, you will have the option to create your project in TypeScript or JavaScript.
