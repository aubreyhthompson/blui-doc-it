# Brightlayer UI Mobile (Hybrid) Frameworks

Brightlayer UI supports hybrid mobile application development using React Native. A summary of React Native capabilities is outlined below:

## React Native

-   Renders native UI elements (not a WebView)
-   Can re-use application logic code (React)
-   Requires writing new code for UI (learning curve)
-   Does not use CSS for styling (learning curve)
-   Provides access to hardware functionality through various plugins / libraries
-   Has a large community of support
-   Learn more on the [React Native Website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

# Which framework should I use?

This is entirely up to you. If time is your biggest concern, Ionic may be the best approach since it simply wraps an existing application and requires no additional code.  Though not officially supported by Brightlayer UI through themes and code snippets, Ionic remains a viable hybrid alternative.

However, if you want more control over the look and performance of your application, it may be better to use React Native. If you have a React application, you'd be able to re-use most of your application logic, but you have to write custom / dedicated UI views for mobile.

In general, if your development team is more familiar with Angular, we recommended using Ionic. If your team is more familiar with React, you won't go wrong by choosing React Native.

# Building your application

Follow the guidelines for app development using your chosen framework:

-   [React Native](/development/frameworks-mobile/react-native)

These guides will walk you through the process of developing your application and ultimately creating a final binary to distribute (either to your testers or your final customers).

## Deploying your application

Once you have built your application into a distributable binary, there are two options for distributing it.

### Visual Studio App Center (formerly HockeyApp)

Visual Studio App Center gives you a way to test your app with users before you are ready for final distribution. This service allows you to upload app binaries and create lists of people with whom to share them. These people will be notified via email when new versions of the app are available, and they will be prompted to download and install them directly onto their device. You will need to request access to Visual Studio App Center from IT.

### App Store / Play Store

For final distribution of your application, you will need to utilize App Store Connect and / or Google Play Console.
