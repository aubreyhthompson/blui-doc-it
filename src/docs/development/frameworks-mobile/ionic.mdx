# Getting Started with Ionic

The following instructions will guide you through setting up your computer for Ionic development and starting a new PX Blue project. Alternatively, you can start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/pxblue) (the Login example is a good project to start from) once you configure your environment.

# Setting Up Your Environment

You'll need to start by following the general instructions for setting up your development environment for mobile, found in our [Environment Guide](/development/environment). Since Ionic takes advantage of web technologies, you won't need any specific additional tools beyond what you would use for web development.

Ionic uses Cordova behind the scenes but offers some additional convenience tools on top. If you would prefer to write a pure Cordova application, you can read instructions in the [Apache Cordova Getting Started Guide](/development/frameworks-mobile/cordova).

## Installing Ionic

The most up-to-date instructions for setting up Ionic can be found on the [Ionic Website](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

To get started, run:

```sh
npm install -g ionic cordova
// or
yarn global add ionic cordova
```

You'll also want to install some additional dependencies:

```sh
npm install -g native-run gradle cordova-res
// or
yarn global add native-run gradle cordova-res
```

Make sure that you have a `GRADLE_HOME` entry in your PATH variable pointing to your gradle binary directory.

# Creating Your Application

## Using the PX Blue CLI

The fastest way to start a new PX Blue project is to use the [PX Blue CLI](/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using either the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)) with all of the necessary PX Blue dependencies pre-configured. To start an Ionic project:

```sh
npx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new ionic
```

You will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether or not you want to use the PX Blue eslint and prettier configurations files.

The PX Blue CLI will automatically include:

-   Angular Material Component Library ([@angular/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/material))
-   PX Blue Component Library ([@pxblue/angular-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-components))
-   PX Blue Themes ([@pxblue/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes))
-   PX Blue Icons ([@pxblue/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons))
-   PX Blue Colors ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors))
-   PX Blue ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@pxblue/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/eslint-config) / [@pxblue/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/prettier-config))

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [PX Blue CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli).

## Using an Existing Project

If you have an existing project and would like to integrate PX Blue, you can follow the manual integration instructions below. If you have not already started your project, we recommend that you scaffold your project with the PX Blue CLI.

# Manual PX Blue Integration

Please refer to the Manual PX Blue Integration steps for [Angular](/development/frameworks-web/angular).

# Writing an Ionic Application

Developing an Ionic project with Angular is virtually identical to writing a normal web application using Angular.

## Running your application

`ionic serve` will run the application in a web browser on localhost:8100. In order to see the application run on a mobile device, you will need to add platforms.

```sh
ionic cordova platform add android
ionic cordova platform add ios
```

> **NOTE**: You will only be able to add the ios platform if you are developing on a Mac.

When the ionic cordova platform add completes, your project will have all the required native plugins installed along with several configuration files specific to your project.

## Building your application

The project is now ready to build and you can run:

```sh
ionic cordova build android
ionic cordova build ios
```

Once complete, you can run your project in a device simulator (or connected device) by running:

```sh
ionic cordova run android
ionic cordova run ios
```

# Additional Information

## Code Formatting/Style

PX Blue provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the PX Blue team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/code-standards).

> **NOTE**: Depending on your version of Xcode, you may need to specify additional build flags to run on ios: `ionic cordova run ios --buildFlag="-UseModernBuildSystem=0"`.
