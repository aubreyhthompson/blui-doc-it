# Themes

One of the key benefits of PX Blue is the consistency of look & feel between different applications. This is achieved primarily through the use of PX Blue themes. PX Blue offers two themes: a light theme (blue) and a dark theme (blueDark).

## Explore Our Themes

Have a look at the component theme explorer below and learn how PX Blue themes work at a high level. Here we showcase some of the most representative components from Material Design and how our themes affect them.

# Blue Theme / Light Theme

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>
    <ImageGrid images={[LightThemeExample]} regularWidth caption={'An example of a light-themed application.'} />
</div>

The blue theme, inherited and expanded from Material Design's baseline theme, is the default theme for all PX Blue applications. With a clean color vibrance and high text legibility, it is designed to suit day-to-day use on a computer monitor, on-site facility inspection with a tablet, and on a mobile phone screen. It should be applied at the root level of your app.

The light theme uses our iconic [Blue 500](/style/color) color (`#007bc1`) throughout the application, notably in toolbars, buttons, and icons. In some places, Light Blue 500 is applied as an accent color on interactive UI elements such as form controls. The light theme's base background color is White 200, although the surface elements are often shaded in White 50 (pure white).

# Dark Theme / Blue Dark Theme

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>
    <ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeExample]} regularWidth caption={'An example of a dark-themed application.'} />
</div>

The dark theme is intended primarily for applications used in low-light conditions. As the name indicates, it utilizes different shades of dark colors (grays and blacks) and uses other colors only for interactive components and status displays.

<ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeColors]} regularWidth />

To accommodate for [accessibility requirements](/design/accessibility), PX Blue uses the 200 shade of colors when text is used on a dark background, such as in an outlined button and a text field label. For "contained" elements, such as in an elevated / contained button, the same style is used as in the light theme (500 shades).

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[OutlinedAndFlat]}
        caption={`You may use the 200 shade of text colors on a dark background (1) or White 50 on 500 shades (2). However, the 200 shades should never be used as a background color (3), as they glare in a dark environment.`}
        regularWidth
    />
    <ImageGrid
        images={[DarkThemeElevation]}
        caption={[
            'In dark theme, you can express surface elevation with:',
            '1: A different surface color. (Optionally, you may apply a drop shadow to further define the edge.)',
            '2: Use outlined component style.',
            '3: However, you should never use SOLELY the drop shadow, no matter how dark the shadow is.',
        ]}
        regularWidth
    />
</div>

# Developers

## Angular and Ionic

Angular themes are available from our @pxblue/angular-themes package, which is a collection of SCSS stylesheets that are imported into your application and applied via classes (`pxb-blue` or `pxb-dark`) to both PX Blue components and Angular Material components.

-   @pxblue/angular-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/themes/tree/master/angular)
-   [Theming Guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) on Angular Material

If you are using Ionic for hybrid application development, you can utilize our Angular themes as well. See [our Ionic getting started guide](/frameworks-mobile/ionic).

## React

React themes are available from our @pxblue/react-themes package, which contains JSON objects that are consumed by the theme mechanism for Material UI components (`<ThemeProvider />`), including some specific styling rules defined in [JSS](https://material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/).

-   @pxblue/react-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/themes/tree/master/react)
-   [Theming Guide](https://material-ui.com/customization/themes/) on Material-UI

## React Native

React Native themes are available from our @pxblue/react-themes package, which utilize React Native Paper's theming mechanism. This package contains two separate dark themes which must be applied to different components to achieve the correct appearance (see the package readme for details).

-   @pxblue/react-native-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/themes/tree/master/react-native)
-   [Theming Guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html) on React Native Paper

## Color Palette

All of the [PX Blue colors](/style/color) are available individually ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors)) for use in your application. However, in most cases, you should use values from the themes to alter styles for better future-proofing.
