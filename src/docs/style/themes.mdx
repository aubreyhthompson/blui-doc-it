# Themes

One of the key benefits of PX Blue is consistency of look & feel between different applications. This is achieved primarily through the use of PX Blue themes. PX Blue offers two themes: a light theme (blue) and a dark theme (blueDark).

## Explore Our Themes

Have a look at the component theme explorer below and learn how PX Blue themes work on a high level. The theme explorer selectively showcases some of the most representative components from Material Design and from our component library that fabrics our theme.

You are also encouraged to visit our code examples, modify our code, and see the magic happens in real time.

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>

        angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-showcase-demo/tree/master`}
        react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-showcase-demo/tree/master`}

# Blue Theme / Light Theme

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>
    <ImageGrid images={[LightThemeExample]} regularWidth caption={'An example of a light-themed application.'} />
</div>

The blue theme, inherited and expanded from Material Design's baseline theme, is the default theme for all PX Blue applications. With a clean color vibrance and high text legibility, it is designed to suit day to day use on a computer monitor, on-site facility inspection with a tablet, and on a mobile phone screen. It should be applied at the root level of your app.

The blue theme uses our [iconic Blue 500 color](/style/color) (`#007bc1`) throughout the application, notably in toolbars, buttons and icons. Occasionally you will notice a accent / secondary color, Light Blue 500, being applied to interactive UI elements such as form controls. Blue theme's base background color is White 200, although the surface elements are often shaded in pure White (White 50).

<Divider />

# Blue Dark Theme

<div style={REGULAR_WIDTH_STYLE}>
    <ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeExample]} regularWidth caption={'An example of a dark-themed application.'} />
</div>

The blue dark theme is constructed in a similiar fashion just like the blue theme, but is intended primarily for applications used in low-light conditions. As the name indicates, the blue dark theme is dominated by different shades of dark colors, and uses colors only to for interactive components and status displays.

<ImageGrid images={[DarkThemeColors]} regularWidth />

To accomodate for [accessibility requirements](/design/accessibility), PX Blue uses 200 colors when a text shows by itself on a dark background, such as in an outlined button and a text field label. For a "contained" element, such as in an elevated / contained button, the style remains Blue 500 on White.

# Developers

## Angular and Ionic

PX Blue offers the theming support via the package [@pxblue/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes), which is a collection of SCSS stylesheets that are imported into your application and applied through classes (`pxb-blue` or `pxb-dark`), to both PX Blue components and Angular Material components.

-   @pxblue/angular-themes: [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/angular-themes), [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/themes/tree/master/angular)
-   [Theming Guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) on Angular Material

If you are using Ionic for hybrid application development, you can utilize our Angular themes as well. See [our Ionic getting started guide](/frameworks-mobile/ionic).

## React

PX Blue's React themes are packaged through [@pxblue/react-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-themes). It contains JSON objects that are consumed by the theme mechanism for Material UI components (`<ThemeProvider />`). The package also contains some specific rules defined in [JSS](https://material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/).

-   [Theming Guide](https://material-ui.com/customization/themes/) on Material-UI

## React Native

React Native themes are encapsulated in [@pxblue/react-native-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-themes), which relies on React Native Paper's theming mechanism.

## Color Palette

All of the [PX Blue colors](/style/color) are available individually ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors)) for use in your application. However, for the most part, you should rely on our themes packages to alter the styles.
