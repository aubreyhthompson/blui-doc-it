# Power Xpert Blue Themes

One of the key benefits of PX Blue is consistency of look & feel between different applications. This is achieved primarily through the use of PX Blue themes. PX Blue offers two themes: a blue theme (light theme) and a blue dark theme.

# Blue Theme

Blue theme is the default theme for all PX Blue applications.

# Available Themes

<ImageGrid
    images={[LightThemeImage, DarkThemeImage]}
    caption={'PX Blue offers a light theme (default theme) and a dark theme (for low-light condition usage).'}
/>

The PX Blue themes packages includes two distinct themes:

-   **Blue** is the default theme for all PX Blue applications. It should be applied at the root level of your app. It provides a variety of shades of blue for use in buttons, toolbars, etc. The standard background color is a light gray.
-   **Blue Dark** is complementary to the Blue theme. It is intended primarily for applications used in low-light conditions. The primary colors used in the Blue Dark theme are various shades of gray with blue accents. It can be used as a standalone theme or combined with the Blue (default) theme to provide contrast for areas such as detail sidebars.

<DemoCard
    repository={'showcase-demo'}
    angular={`https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-showcase-demo/tree/master`}
    react={`https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-showcase-demo/tree/master`}
/>

> **NOTE:** Combining multiple themes in your application is optional. You may stick to using a single theme (Blue) for your entire application and then apply one-off styling where necessary to achieve other effects.

# Developers

## Theme Formats

-   **Angular** themes are a collection of SCSS stylesheets that are imported into your application and applied through classes ('pxb-blue' or 'pxb-dark').

-   **React** themes are JSON objects that are consumed by the theme mechanism for Material UI components (`<MuiThemeProvider>`). They also contain some specific rules defined in [JSS](https://material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/).

> **NOTE:** If you are using Ionic for hybrid application development, you can utilize the Angular themes and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) component library. A future version of PX Blue will include more robust theming for React Native applications.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions for PX Blue themes, you can read the package instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/pxblue/themes#px-blue-themes-for-eaton-applications) or our getting started guides for [Angular](/development/frameworks-web/angular) and [React](/development/frameworks-web/react). For additional information on how Material component libraries apply themes, see [Angular Material Theming](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) or [Material UI Theming](https://material-ui.com/customization/themes/).

> All of the [PX Blue colors](/style/color) are available individually ([@pxblue/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/colors)) for use in your application.
