# Iconography guidelines

Brightlayer UI is built on top of the Google Material design system, which allows us to take advantage
of their extensive icon library and icon grid. These icons are available automatically when you use one
of our supported Material component frameworks. Brightlayer UI also includes a number of supplemental icons
specific to Brightlayer UI products.

These icons are available in a variety of formats - select an icon below to view its usage instructions.

<RegularWidth>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'System icons'}
        url={'https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#'}
        description={`Material Design's guidelines on creating your own icons.`}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={`Material's icon`}
        url={'https://material.io/resources/icons/'}
        description={'List of Material Design icons. They are also included in the table below.'}
        style={{ marginRight: 0 }}
    />
</RegularWidth>
<IconBrowser />

## Progress icons

Brightlayer UI also offers a number of icons that can be used to show progress, health, or other
percentage-based metrics. These can be dynamically adjusted programmatically (fill amount, color, size)
based on properties in your application. You can read more about using these components on
[Github](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/progress-icons/tree/master).

<ProgressIconCard />
<Divider />

# Still can't find what you need?

If you decide that an icon is appropriate and there are no suitable options available, you can
[Contact Us](/community/contactus) to request a new icon. Please include a brief description of what the intended use is, and if possible a
picture of where it will live in the context of your application. The UX team will review your request
and provide a recommendation within 48 hours as to whether a new icon should be created or if an
existing icon is available for you to use.

If you are looking for the Brightlayer UI 1.0 symbols, please refer to our [Github](https://github.com/brightlayer-ui/symbols/tree/master).

If you have your own design resources who are able to create icons, you can build these on your own,
following the [Material Icon Guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html)
to maintain a common look and feel. If you do not have your own designers, we can work with you to build
the icon you need. We can either build the icon in house or recommend external resources that you can
use. Please note that going this route may take extra time, so try to get requests in as early as
possible. If you are making your own icons, please consider contributing these back into the Brightlayer UI
icon library (subject to review).
