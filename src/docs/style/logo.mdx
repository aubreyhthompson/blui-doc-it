# App Logos

App logos are the primary way users identify an app or a product. Not only do they appear on user's app launcher screen, app logos are also present in app markets like App Store and Google Play, company's product page, browser tabs, emails, and the app itself. They serve a critical function in a product's identity.

The following guideline is our recommendation for Eaton product team to follow.

# App Logos, Icons, and Pictograms

<!-- This section is adapted directly from icon guidelines. If you change something here, you may need to change it in the other file. -->

<ImageGrid
    images={[ExampleOfLogo, ExampleOfIcon, ExampleOfPictogram]}

This guide talks specifically about the design of app logos, which should not be confused with other glyphs, such as icons and pictograms. App logos, sometimes referred to as "app icons", are symbols of products and apps, usually protected under trademark laws. [Icons](/style/icon-guidelines) symbolize common actions, objects, or ideas used to aid users. Pictograms are typically used on websites for decorative purposes only.

> Note: if you need to use logos from other companies — such as a payment processor — make sure that you are compliant with their branding guidelines.

# Examples

Listed below are some existing app logos used by Eaton apps. Copyright all rights reserved Eaton.

<ImageGrid images={[ExistingEatonAppLogos]} caption={`Some logo examples from existing Eaton apps.`} regularWidth />

# Anatomy

A standard Eaton app logo consists of three parts:

<ImageGrid images={[Anatomy]} caption={[`1: Background`, `2: Glyph`, `3: Bottom badge`]} />

# Design Steps

## Tools

We recommend vector graphics design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Figma to design your product logo. Raster graphic tools such as Adobe Photoshop might be useful for final touches like pixel hinting, but they are not designed for vector graphics. Do not use raster graphics tools such as Adobe Photoshop to design the foundation, because they are specialized in generating raster graphics that are not scalable.

You can usually export image assets from these software at different resolutions to meet the need from different platforms. There are also online tools, such as [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/) to help with this process.

Some platforms may have specialized tools to preview the app logo. Android, for example, encourages developers to create adaptive icons using [Android Studio's Image Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#create-adaptive). Amazon Alexa has a web tool,[Alexa Icon Builder](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2018/08/create-eye-catching-icons-for-your-alexa-skills-in-minutes1), to allow users to generate Alexa Skill logos quickly.

## Bottom Badge

The bottom badges are not meant to be modified. You are expected to leave the bottom badge as-it-is in the logo templates.

<ImageGrid
    images={[BottomBadge1, BottomBadge2, BottomBadge3, BottomBadge4, BottomBadge5]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DO: Use the default badge as-it-is.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge logo color.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge size or the logo size.`,
        `DONT: Don't modify the badge effects or add shadows.`,
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 6, md: 4 }}
/>

## Background

Most Eaton app logos use [the primary blue](/style/color?category=ui&name=blue&weight=500) as their background. Some also select the background color from one of the [branding colors](/style/color#branding-colors) to stay consistent with colors present in their product marketing.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Background1]}
    captionsUnderImages={[`Use the primary blue or one of the branding colors as a foundation for the background.`]}
    regularWidth
/>

<ImageGrid
    images={[Background2, Background3]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `DONT: Do not use a photo in the logo.`,
        `DONT: Do not use a screenshot or app UI in the logo.`,
    ]}
/>

<ImageGrid
    images={[Background4]}
    caption={`In addition to a plain blue background (#1), you may also consider adding a subtle corner gradient (#2) or a subtle center gradient (#3).`}
    regularWidth
/>

## Glyph

A glyph is a simple shape representing an object, action, or idea. Your glyph must be simple, recognizable and scalable to ensure that your app can be easily identified on multiple devices with different resolution.

We recommend you select your base glyph from our [icon library](/style/icon-library).

<ImageGrid
    images={[Glyph1, Glyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `AVOID: Avoid the use of mnemonic logos or logotypes when possible. They are often not meaningful for first-time users.`,
        `DO: Use a graphical way to represent an application or product.`,
    ]}
/>

**what did PX Dashboard ended up using? Should I encourage people to design in the fancy PXD way?**

Do not use the Eaton logo as a glyph — your app should not be presented as the "Eaton" app. It is not unusual for a customer to have multiple Eaton products and applications installed on their devices, and if every one of those apps used the Eaton logo it becomes very difficult for a user to tell, at a glance, which application they are looking for.

<ImageGrid images={[Glyph3]} captionsUnderImages={[`DONT: Do not use the Eaton logo as glyphs.`]} />

You should also verify that your product logo is distinguished enough from other existing Eaton product logos.

Glyphs are usually aligned to the keyline (visible in the template) to avoid bleeding beyond the safe zone.

<ImageGrid images={[GlyphKeyline]} captionsUnderImages={[`Align glyphs to the icon template keyline.`]} regularWidth />

Once the base glyph is decided, you can be creative and add variations to the glyph to make it look more designed.

<ImageGrid
    images={[PolishGlyph1, PolishGlyph2]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `Eaton's Smart Energy Manager logo modified the logo shape to accomodate for a bolt glyph inside.`,
        `Predict Pulse logo modified glyph size, opacity and image gradient.`,
    ]}
/>

## Export

When exporting to different platforms, ensure that your logo design is following the platform-specific requirement [as listed below](#logo-requirements-by-platforms).

TALK ABOUT PIXEL HINTING

Rounded corners and shadows should never be exported.

When exporting to specific resolutions it is sometimes helpful to tweak vector shapes so that they fall on exact pixels. This helps maintain a “crisp” look and avoids the blurriness that may occur when edges are in between pixels.

# Logo Requirements by Platforms

<ImageGrid
    images={[LogosOnDifferentPlatforms]}
    caption={[
        `App logos look different on different platforms.`,
        `1: The original design`,
        `2: iOS & iPadOS's rendering`,
        `3. Favicon for web apps, previewed at a high resolution`,
        `4: Amazon Alexa Skills' rendering`,
        `5 — 8: Android's adaptive icon allows phone manufacturers to render app logos in different shapes.`,
    ]}

Different platforms have different product logo requirements — they often have different shapes, resolutions, safe areas, and parallax layers. Click on the links below to learn more about logo guidelines on each platform.

## Favicons

For web apps, we highly recommend redesign the logo specifically for the favicon.

<ImageGrid
    images={[Favicon]}
    caption={[
        `Favicon needs to be recognizable at a size as small as 32×32 pixel.`,
        `1: The original product logo, with the bottom badge removed to allow more room for the glyph.`,
        `2: The same logo, rendered at 32×32, a size widely used by most modern browsers.`,
        `3: The favicon in a browser tab.`,
    ]}
    regularWidth
/>

-   Include background color so that it works against different browser size
    -   **Should I do this? or should I recommend the glyph only part without background, to make the glyph more visible?**
-   Glyphs might be thicker to bring more visibilities
-   Favicon changes depending on the existing system status?

# Design Specs

The templates should already have everything you need. However if you want to do something fancy, here's the design spec for a default logo:

<ImageGrid
    images={[Spec, SpecCircle, SpecColor]}
    captionsUnderImages={[
        `A regular app logo.`,
        `For platforms using round app logo shapes, such as Android's adaptive icon and Amazon Alexa Skills, the badge is smaller to remain visible.`,
        `The glyph should not be brighter than white[50] (pure white) at 90% to avoid it looking too glaring.`,
    ]}
/>
