# Illustrations

Illustrations are design elements that should only be used only for onboarding and [empty states](/patterns/empty-states). Do not use illustrations where you are supposed to use icons.

When creating your own illustrations, you should follow our guidelines as explained below. Alternatively, you may also choose to acquire existing artworks from repositories like [Icons8](https://icons8.com/illustrations), [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/vectors), or [Humaaans Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739503328703046360). We recommend you finalizing the illustration with [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), as it provides more export options.

## Designing the Illustration

### Perspective

Your illustration should be either in a horizontal perspective (neither looking up nor looking down) or in parallel projection.

### Ratio

The width-height ratio should be between 1:1 to 2:3, which gives a margin on a mobile phone for UI interactions. If designing specifically for desktop applications (that is, the illustration will never show up on mobile), you can go wider than that, but no more than 16:9.

### Drawing Style

Keep your style consistent within one application, including your illustrations for the webpage for the product. Do not be too abstract or artistic, as your main goal is to inform your users of certain features in your product, instead of decorating it.

### Text

Avoid the use of text, as they might require translations, and can be hard to see on mobile. If you have to, use Open Sans, just like other PX Blue applications, and ensure that they are legit on the smallest targeted device.

### Color

Use [PX Blue palette](/style/color) as the base color. If there is a gradient, make sure the two ends of the gradient are using PX Blue colors. Use some blue hue (this can be colors from primary blue, Eaton blue, or light blue) somewhere in the foreground for your drawing.

Avoid using colors that may blend into the app theme background (suggest adding a background color to pad around it). Avoid using the 500 colors from the primary color palette, as they may blend with other UI elements (buttons, progressors).

Avoid too many dark strokes for light themes, or light strokes for dark themes. The illustrations might be reused as infographics, and line strokes might intervene with labels.

Test your illustration in both light theme (white 50) and dark theme (black 900). It is recommended that you modify your design for light backgrounds and dark backgrounds.

Simulate your illustrations under different colorblind conditions. Ensure your color schemes are still intact.

## Export

When finished with your artwork, remember to outline stroke. However, if there are texts in your illustration, do not outline stroke any of that -- leave them in as text so that other people can conveniently translate it later, if necessary.

Name and group your root SVG layers semantically for animating. Do not minify the SVG code, as this will eliminate the naming.

Export your illustration in SVG with at least 2 decimal precision & presentation attributes.
