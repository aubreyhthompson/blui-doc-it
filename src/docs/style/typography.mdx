# Typography Guidelines

In general, refer to the typography guidance for [Material.io](https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#).

Unlike Material Design, the primary desktop font for Power Xpert Blue is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) (licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letter forms.

## Type Scale

PX Blue provides a type scale that includes a range of styles to support the needs of your application. All styles and fonts are available in the design library. As PX Blue continues to grow, additional font patterns will be added.

<Divider fullScreen />

# Customization

With a wide range of product needs it is expected that not every predefined style will fit for every application. Slight customization of styles, such as changing Body 2 from semi bold to regular, are acceptable and do not need to be reviewed by the PX Blue governance body. In any case, there should be an understanding from the projects development team that any new style will need to be created by them and not PX Blue. Any created style should still follow the PX Blue system font and adhere to the color guidelines. New font families and colors will need to be approved by the PX Blue governance body.

## When to create custom font styles

New font styles can be created when designs call for font sizes or states that are currently not provided in PX Blue. The most common cases where designs have created a new font style has been the addition of new headline styles and the modification of Body 2 from semi bold to regular. Ultimately it will come down to the designer and whats best for the product. PX Blue is available to provide recommendations and design reviews.
