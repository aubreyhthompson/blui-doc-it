# Typography Guidelines

PX Blue builds off of the Material Design system, so in general, you may refer to the typography guidelines presented at [Material.io](https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#). Below, we cover some of the areas where PX Blue differs from Material Design.

    description={`Material Design's typography guidelines.`}

Unlike Material Design, the primary font for Power Xpert Blue is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) (licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letter forms.

## Type Scale

PX Blue provides a type scale that includes a range of styles to support the needs of your application. All styles and fonts are available in the design library. As PX Blue continues to grow, additional font patterns will be added.

    <ImageGrid images={[TypeScaleImg]} style={{ marginTop: 32 }} regularWidth />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Customization

Different products have different needs, and we do not expect these pre-defined styles will cover every potential use case. Slight customization of these styles, such as changing a font weight in a particular component, are acceptable and expected. In most cases, you should be able to adjust existing styles without having to define an entirely new style. If you find that you must create new styles (see below), they should still use the PX Blue font (Open Sans) and adhere to our color guidelines.

<ImageGrid images={[LargerApplicationImg]} style={{ marginTop: 32 }} regularWidth />

## When to create custom font styles

New font styles can be created when a design calls for additional font sizes or states that are currently not available in PX Blue. The most common cases for custom styles have been additional headline styles (in certain components) and the modification of Body 2 from semi-bold to regular. Ultimately, the need for custom styles depends on you and what's best for the product. PX Blue is available to provide recommendations and design reviews. If you need help defining a new style, do not hesitate to [contact us](/community/contactus)!

The examples below depict how the designs would look using standard PX Blue compared to how the design looks with new created font styles.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[ApplicationImg]}
        regularWidth
        caption={['1: Card layout using default PX Blue styles', '2: Card layout using custom created styles']}
    />
    <ImageGrid
        images={[HeadlineOptionsImg]}
        regularWidth
        caption={[
            '1: Two line headline using default PX Blue styles',
            '2: Two line headline using custom created styles',
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Internationalization

<ImageGrid
    images={[SimplifiedChineseImg]}
    regularWidth
    caption={['Use "Noto Sans CJK SC" font for Simplified Chinese.']}
/>

PX Blue recommends using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) for all non-western languages. You should choose the appropriate font based on the language you are designging for.
