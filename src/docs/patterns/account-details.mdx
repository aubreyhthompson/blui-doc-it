# Account Details

<ImageGrid images={[Banner]} regularWidth />

When applications implement a form of [User Authentication](/patterns/user-auth), they must include ways for users to view / update their personal or account information as well as take account-related actions, such as logging out of the application or changing a password. There are several ways to present this information to the user in a PX Blue application.

<React.Fragment>
    <TOC
        anchors={[
            { title: 'Introduction', hash: '#account-details' },
            { title: 'Account Settings Page', hash: '#account-settings-page' },
            { title: 'In a Navigation Drawer', hash: '#in-a-navigation-drawer' },
            { title: 'In a User Menu', hash: '#in-a-user-menu' },
            { title: 'Contents', hash: '#contents' },
            { title: 'Design Specifications', hash: '#design-specifications' },
            { title: 'Developers', hash: '#developers' },
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Account Settings Page

<ImageGrid
    images={[AccountSettingsPage]}
    caption={`A basic account settings page with typical user information and options.`}
/>

At a minimum, your application should implement a dedicated account settings page for viewing and editing a user's account details, preferences, settings, etc. This page should also include a way for users to take account-related actions. The style of this page should be consistent with other settings pages in your application, if applicable. If you have multiple settings pages in your application, the account settings should be easily accessible from the top level.

# In a Navigation Drawer

<ImageGrid
    images={[DrawerAccountDetails]}
    caption={`A navigation drawer showing basic user details and account-related actions.`}
/>

If your application is using [Drawer Navigation](/patterns/navigation#drawer-navigation), you can include quick-access user information and actions in the Drawer. Commonly, this involves placing an avatar in the drawer header along with basic information about the user (e.g., their name, username, email address, job title and / or organization affiliation). Additional account actions and a link to the account settings page can be placed at the bottom of the drawer body, just above the footer, if present (see the [contents](/patterns/account-details#contents) section below).

This approach is most effective when there are relatively few account-related actions. If you are using a navigation rail, you may place account settings links in the rail, but you will not be able to show specific details about the user. Consider using the [User Menu](#via-user-menu) in this situation or if you are using a primary navigation mechanism other than a drawer.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Drawer Navigation'}
        url={'/patterns/navigation#drawer-navigation'}
        description={`Follow PX Blue's guideline for using a Drawer.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# In a User Menu

<ImageGrid
    images={[DesktopUserMenu]}
    regularWidth
    caption={`The user menu is controlled by an Avatar button and displays useful user-related information and actions.`}
/>

Another way to present user information and actions is with the user menu. The user menu appears as an Avatar in the [App Bar](/patterns/appbar) which opens a menu with the user-related content (see the [contents](#contents) section below).

This approach is most effective if you have more than three account-related actions, or if you want to present more detailed information about a user since it avoids cluttering the primary navigation drawer.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[MobileUserMenu]}
        caption={`On mobile-sized screens, the menu contents should be presented in a bottom sheet.`}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Bottom Sheet'}
        url={'/patterns/overlay#bottom-sheet'}
        description={`Follow PX Blue's guideline for using a Bottom Sheet.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Contents

Whether you are using the drawer or a dedicated user menu component, the content should be very similar.

## Avatar

In the header, you should present an avatar that identifies the user along with basic information about them, such as their name, username, email, job title, etc. The avatar can take several forms. Usually, it will display a user-selected profile picture. If your application does not support user-selected images, you can default to displaying the user's initials or a generic [person icon](/style/iconography?icon=Person&isMaterial=true).

## Account Functions

Most account functions can be located on the account settings page, but you should provide access to the most common / frequent actions in the drawer or user menu as well.

You should at least include:

-   A link to the account settings page
-   A Log Out button
-   Links to terms of service / privacy policy / license information (if applicable)

When using the user menu, you will likely have more room available if you wish to include other frequently accessed account functions, such as change password, contact support, etc.
