# App Bars

<ImageGrid images={[Banner]} regularWidth />

App bars, sometimes called toolbars, are often one of the first elements you see in an application. They are primarily used to provide context for where a user is in the hierarchy of the application.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'App Bars: Top'} url={'https://material.io/components/app-bars-top/'} />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Basic App Bar

The basic app bar provides information about the current screen. Typically, this is a short title that indicates which screen the user is on (e.g., "Settings"). However, the app bar can also contain a navigation icon, subtitle, and/or various global action buttons for the screen. When placing actions in the app bar, limit yourself to no more than three. If you have more actions than this, consider grouping them into a menu.

<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[BasicBars]} caption={'Basic app bars in order of increasing complexity.'} />

## Dropdown Toolbar

A special case of the basic app bar is the dropdown toolbar. This version transforms the simple text subtitle of the app bar into a dropdown menu that can be used to configure the page. For example, you may have a dropdown that allows users to switch between different physical locations on an overview screen.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[DropdownVariations]}
        caption={
            ('1. On mobile, the dropdown toolbar opens the options panel in a bottom sheet.',
            '2. On desktop, the dropdown opens as a menu below the toolbar.')
        }
    />
    <DemoCard
        repository={'Dropdown Toolbar'}
        angular={
            'https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/components-dropdown-toolbar--with-full-config'
        }
        react={'https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/story/components-dropdown-toolbar--with-full-config'}
        ionic
        reactNative
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Collapsible App Bar

<ImageGrid
    images={[Image1, Image2]}
    caption={'A collapsible app bar shrinks and gets pinned to the top when the page is scrolled.'}
/>
<DemoCard repository={'collapsible-appbar'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fapp-bar%2Fcollapsible-app-bar%2Fcollapsible-app-bar.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/collapsible-app-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=collapsible'} ionic reactNative />

In some situations, you may want to present more than just a title and subtitle in an app bar, such as a large graphic, buttons, or multiple lines of text. In these cases, you can use a taller app bar that will shrink as the user scrolls down the page until it becomes a basic app bar. This allows you the flexibility to present an eye-catching banner without permanently reducing the amount of usable space on the page. This is a pattern most commonly used for mobile applications, but could also be used for web.

The collapsible appbar should transition smoothly between the expanded and collapsed states â€” this means you will need to account for how the app bar will look throughout the transition. Because elements will disappear as the app bar shrinks, you'll need to use dynamic text scaling, opacity transitions, and / or other techniques to do this smoothly, depending on your content.

# Search Bar

<ImageGrid
    images={[Image3, Image4]}
    caption={'When the search icon is clicked, a white search bar will slide in and cover the default tool bar. '}
/>
<DemoCard repository={'search-bar'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Fapp-bar%2Fsearch-bar%2Fsearch-bar.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/search-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=search'} ionic reactNative />

A very common pattern seen in many types of applications is the ability to search for data on a page. This is achieved by placing a search icon/button in the app bar. When this button is clicked, a white search bar slides in from the right to cover the default app bar. As the user enters text into the search field, the data is filtered in real-time. A back icon will close the Search Bar and clear the search results.

## Auto-complete

For more advanced searching, you may wish to include an auto-complete feature. You can implement autocomplete by including a contextual menu below the search bar with suggested search items. Alternatively, you can use type-ahead to automatically update the recommended search query in the search field as the user types (Google search does this).
