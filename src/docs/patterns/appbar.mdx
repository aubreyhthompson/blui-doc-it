# App Bar Patterns

App bars are useful in a variety of locations throughout PX Blue applications. They are typically used to provide a title or description for a collection of data that follows. They may also contain a menu and/or various actions that can be performed.

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'App Bars: Top'} url={'https://material.io/components/app-bars-top/'} />

## A Basic App Bar

The most basic app bar is used at the top of a page as a title bar. It will have a menu button to the left (used to toggle a navigation menu/drawer) followed by one or two lines of text (title/subtitle) and, optionally, a dropdown with global page actions. Basic app bars can also be used to provide more detailed headers for Cards.

## Collapsible App Bar

<ImageGrid
    images={[Image1, Image2]}
    caption={'A collapsible app bar shrinks and gets pinned to the top when the page is scrolled.'}
/>
<DemoCard repository={'collapsible-appbar'} angular react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/collapsible-app-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=collapsible'} ionic reactNative />

In some situations, you may want to present more information in an app bar, such as a large graphic, buttons, or multiple lines of text. In these cases, you can use a taller app bar that will shrink as the user scrolls down the page and be replaced by a basic app bar. This allows you the flexibility to present an eye-catching banner without permanently reducing the amount of usable space on the page. This is a pattern most commonly used for mobile applications, but could also be used at a larger scale.

## Search Bar

<ImageGrid
    images={[Image3, Image4]}
    caption={'When the search icon is clicked, a white search bar will slide in and cover the default tool bar. '}
/>
<DemoCard repository={'search-bar'} angular react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/app-bar/search-bar/index.tsx&initialpath=search'} ionic reactNative />

A very common pattern seen in many types of applications is the ability to search for data on a page. This is achieved by placing a search icon/button in the app bar. When this button is clicked, a white Search Bar slides in from the right to cover the default toolbar. As the user enters text into the search field, the data is filtered in real-time.
