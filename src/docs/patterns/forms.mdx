# Form Validation Patterns

<ImageGrid images={[Image1, Image2, Image3]} />

Forms are an integral part of many applications, particularly during the user registration phase. One of the most important parts of working with forms is properly validating the information that users enter into them. In general, PX Blue follows the form behaviors explained in detail by Material Design.

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Text Fields'} url={'https://material.io/components/text-fields/'} />
<DemoCard repository={'form-validation'} angular react/>

## Optional vs. Required Fields

When using a mixture of optional and required fields in a form, the inputs should be labeled appropriately.

If most of the fields are required, you should call out the fields that are optional. These fields should be labeled with an appropriate descriptor, followed by "optional" in parentheses.

Conversely, if most of your fields are optional, you should only call out the required fields. These should be identified by an asterisk (\*) after the field label. There should be a descriptor nearby that indicates that a \* means the field is required.

## Form Length

The form should not be too lengthy. Consider breaking long forms into subsections or multiple pages using tabs and [steppers](/patterns/steppers).

## Form Field Requirements

<ImageGrid images={[Image4, Image5, Image6]} caption={'A common application of form validation -- reset password.'} />

If your form fields have complex requirements for valid values, you can list these criteria below the input. A common use case for this is when displaying password complexity requirements.

## Handling Errors

If there is an error with the data entered into a field, the field should indicate to the user that there is a problem. Label and helper text should be changed to a red color and a warning icon should appear in the text input. The error message should be displayed in the helper text location below the field (any existing helper text should be replaced with the error message).

Error messages should be succinct and should not provide information that could compromise security (e.g., "Invalid Credentials" instead of "Incorrect Password").

## When to Verify User Input

In general, there are three acceptable times to perform form field verification:

-   on blur: the field is verified when the user clicks away from it
-   on change: the field is dynamically verified on each keystroke or change in the value
-   manually: fields are verified after performing a specific action (such as clicking a button)

### Verifying on Blur

In order to avoid distracting or confusing a user, most text fields should verify input when the field loses focus. Error messages should not appear until the user is finished entering data and the field is no longer in focus.

<ImageGrid
    images={[OnBlurImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        '1: Do not check for validity or display error messages when the user is typing in the field.',
        '2: The user is finished and the input has lost focus (i.e., "blurred"). Now the input should be verified.',
    ]}
/>

### Verifying on Change

Some fields should verify the user input as it changes. The most common case for this type of verification is a new password field (or a confirm password field). The verification feedback should be displayed / updated each time the user makes a change to the input field.

<ImageGrid
    images={[OnChangeImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        '1: The password criteria checks shall be updated as the user changes their input.',
        '2: “Confirm Password” field should check for a match with password to give immediate feedback for when the user can proceed.',
    ]}
/>

### Verifying Manually

In some specific situations, you may need to defer verification or perform it for all fields in a form at once. This type of verification is common when the checks cannot be performed on the client (such as making an API call to verify a registration code, check user login credentials, or search for a device on the network). In most cases, you can do some preliminary checks using one of the two methods above (e.g., you can check if the email is a valid email before making the API call to verify the credentials).

<ImageGrid
    images={[OnPageChangeImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',
        '1: The helper text will be replaced by the error message. ',
        '2: Use a circular progress indicator when waiting for responses from the server.',
    ]}
/>

## Submitting the Form

Typically, forms should have a button to submit the data or continue to the next part of the form (for long forms). Depending on what happens next, the button should be labeled "next", "finish", or similar. should be located at the bottom right corner of the form (bottom left for right-to-left languages).

<ImageGrid
    images={[SumbitButtonLocationImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        '1: On desktops, the button is placed in the bottom corner of the form.',
        '2: On mobile devices, the button is occluded by the native keyboard.',
    ]}
/>
<ImageGrid
    images={[NextButtonUsageImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        'On mobile, if there are multiple input fields on the screen, the keyboard button should say "next".',
        '1: The user entered a valid input. Clicking "next" will autofocus the user to the next text field.',
        '2: The user entered an invalid input. Clicking "next" will display the error message but will not autofocus to the next text field.'
    ]}
/>

### Disabling the Submit Button

When there are just a few text fields, the submit button can be disabled to indicate that there are some errors in the user input.

<ImageGrid
    images={[SubmitButtonOnChangeImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={
        'If you have only one input field, and this field is verified on change, disable the submit button until the user enters a valid input.'
    }
/>
<ImageGrid
    images={[SubmitButtonAutoSubmitImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={
        'For the verification code screen, you can auto-submit the information once the user input reaches the required length (#2). After the verification code is recognized (#3), the screen pauses for a short moment before automatically moving to the next screen. The verify button is preserved for consistency.'
    }
/>

If at least one text field uses the 'verify on blur' strategy, do not disable the submit button. Otherwise, the mobile user will have to disable their keyboard first to have their input field verified, before they can click the submit button. The only exception is if there are required input fields.

<ImageGrid
    images={[SubmitButtonOnBlurImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={'The submit button is disabled until the user has entered something for all the required fields.'}
/>

When you have a long form (more than three text fields) and the user forgets a required field, do not disable the submit button and force the user to search for what they are missing. Instead, allow the user to click the submit button, and highlight the errors for them.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[SubmitButtonOnClickImage]}
        gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
        caption={
            'For a long form, do not disable the submit button. Instead, highlight the errors after the user clicks "submit".'
        }
    />
</React.Fragment>
<Divider />
