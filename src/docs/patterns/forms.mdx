# Form Validation Patterns

<ImageGrid images={[Image1, Image2, Image3]} />

Forms are an integral part of many applications, particularly during the user registration phase. One of the most important parts of working with forms is properly validating the information that users enter into them. In general, PX Blue follows the form behaviors explained in detail by the Material Design.

## Optional vs. Required Fields

When using a mixture of optional and required fields in a form, the inputs should be labeled appropriately.

If most of the fields are required, you should call out the fields that are optional. These fields should be labeled with an appropriate descriptor, followed by "optional" in parentheses.

Conversely, if most of your fields are optional, you should only call out the required fields. These should be identified by an asterisk (\*) after the field label. There should be a descriptor nearby that indicates that a \* means the field is required.

## Form Field Requirements

If your form fields have complex requirements for valid values, you can list these criteria below the input. A common use case for this is when displaying password complexity requirements.

## Handling Errors

If there is an error with the data entered into a field, the field should indicate to the user that there is a problem. Label and helper text should be changed to a red color and a warning icon should appear in the text input. The error message should be displayed in the helper text location below the field (any existing helper text should be replaced with the error message).

Error messages should be succinct and should not provide information that could compromise security (e.g., "Invalid Credentials" instead of "Incorrect Password").

In general, there are two different types of input field verification: those performing the validity check when the user defocuses/"blurs away" from the text field ("on blur"), and those doing it when user makes any changes ("on change").

<ImageGrid
    images={[OnBlurImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        'In order to not "push" the user to much, most text field should remain "verify on blur".',
        '1: Do not check for validity or display error messages when the user is typing the desired text.',
        '2: The user is finished and defocus / “blurred away” from the input field. Now their input should be checked.',
    ]}
/>
<ImageGrid
    images={[OnChangeImage]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 12 }}
    caption={[
        'When it comes to a password field, the validity check feedback should be displayed each time the user makes a change to the input field.',
        '1: The criteria for the password shall be displayed interactively while the user is changing their input.',
        '2: “Confirm Password” field should behave like a regular text field and do “verify input on blur”.',
    ]}
/>
