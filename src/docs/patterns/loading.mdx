# Loading & Waiting

Often times, your application will need to load data from (or send data to) a remote location with some amount of latency. When this happens, you will need to provide some indication to the user that something is happening. Different situations may call for different styles of indicator, explained below.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Progress Indicators'}
        url={'https://material.io/components/progress-indicators'}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Anatomy

## Variations

### Initial Page Loading

When loading data for the first time, you do not want to show an empty screen while you are fetching the data. Instead, you should show placeholders that mimic (using simple shapes) the data that will eventually be loaded. This will give the impression that your application is faster and gives users an indication of what kind of data is being loaded.

The placeholder should match as closely as possible the real structure of the data. For example, if you are loading a list where each item has an icon, two lines of text, and an action button, then your placeholder should have a circle, two rectangles for the text, and another rectangle for the button. You should show as many placeholder elements as necessary to fill the area in the application that is loading data.

There are a number of libraries available to help you create this placeholder content, such as:

-   [@netbasal/ngx-content-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@netbasal/ngx-content-loader) (Angular, Ionic)
-   [ion-skeleton-text](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/skeleton-text) (Ionic)
-   [placeholder-loading](https://www.npmjs.com/package/placeholder-loading) (React, Angular, Ionic)
-   [react-content-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-content-loader) (React)
-   [rn-placeholder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-placeholder) (React Native)

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[Image1, Image2]}
        caption={'When data is loading, use placeholder shapes for where the data will appear.'}
    />
    <DemoCard
        repository={'loading-states'}
        angular={
            'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Floading-states%2Floading-states.component.ts'
        }
        react={
            'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/loading-states/index.tsx&initialpath=loading-states'
        }
        ionic
        reactNative
    />
</React.Fragment>

### Full Screen

Full screen progress indicators can be used when transitioning between multiple screens in a workflow (such as user registration) or refreshing / reloading a particular element on a page. These make use of a semi-transparent overlay with a large, centered spinner. This variation of indicator is useful when you want to block user interaction with the screen (or a section of the screen) while processing occurs.

### Inline Spinners

Inline spinners can be used as an alternative to full-screen loading indicators. The most common application of inline spinners is during [Form](/patterns/forms) submission / verification. If you need to wait for a server response to validate inputs in a form (after clicking the submit button), you should disable the submit button and replace its label with a spinner. If the verification succeeds, the application should proceed to the next screen. If verification fails, the appropriate error messages should be displayed and the submit button label restored.

<ImageGrid
    images={[InlineSpinner]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        'After the user clicks the submit button, the app waits for the server response, and displays an error message.',
        '1: The helper text will be replaced by the error message. ',
        '2: Use a circular progress indicator when waiting for responses from the server.',
    ]}
/>

### Progress Bars

Progress bars should be used sparingly in your application. They should only be used in situations where progress is discrete / measurable. For example, it could be used to indicate progress through a multi-step workflow or when uploading a file to a server.

# Behavior

## Refreshing Data

### Real-time Data (Polling / Pub-Sub)

If you are showing real-time data (either via polling or a push mechanism from the server), there is no need to show loading indicators. If you wish, you can display a small indicator when data is being refreshed or mention somewhere on the screen when the data was last refreshed so users can identify if the data is stale. You should avoid showing a loading indicator if your data is refreshed more than once per minute.

### Manual Refresh

If your users can manually refresh data on the screen, you may wish to show the placeholder elements (as with initial load), or simply refresh the data behind the scenes without indication (as with real-time). Ultimately, this should depend on how long it takes to refresh the data - if it takes more than one second to load the data, you should use an indicator.
