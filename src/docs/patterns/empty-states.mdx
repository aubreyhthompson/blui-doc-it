# Empty States

At times, there may be areas of your application that do not have data available to display. This can happen when there is an error loading data, there are no results for a particular search or filter criteria, etc. This is where empty state indicators come into play.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Empty States'}
        url={'https://material.io/design/communication/empty-states.html'}
    />

    />
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[Image1]}
        caption={[
            '1: Mobile screen showing empty state as a functionality placeholder.',
            '2: Desktop screen with empty state and call to action button.',
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# When to Use / When Not to Use

You can refer to the Material Design Empty States guidelines for general usage instructions.

Empty states can be used in a variety of ways in your application. As the name suggests, they can alert users to empty data, but they can also be used to indicate:

-   No Data Available
-   Empty Search/Filter Results
-   Networking Errors
-   Lack of Permissions
-   Future Features / Placeholders
-   Success Screens

Empty states should **NOT** be used for:

-   [Loading indicators](/patterns/loading)
-   Welcome Screens

# Anatomy

Empty states should include a large icon or graphic followed a brief headline/message. If necessary, additional explanatory text may follow.

The text on the screen should clearly indicate why there is no data to display, and what (if anything) can be done to make data available. The text should be minimal, but enough to convey the necessary message.

If the data is empty but could be populated by a user action (such as adding a device to an empty device list), there should be a call-to-action button that will allow the user to add data.

## Variations

<ImageGrid
    images={[DesktopImage, ElementImage]}
    caption={['1: A full-screen empty state.', '2: Empty state shown on an element (card).']}
/>

### Full-screen

In the most common cases, Empty States should be used full-screen as the only content on a page. In this situation, the indicator should be centered on the page. In some cases, you may wish to use a large graphic as the background of the entire page as well (such as for features that will be coming soon).

### Element-level

While less common, empty states can also be used as an indicator for individual sections of a page rather than the entire page (such as a single card having no data on a dashboard / overview screen). In these cases, it may be appropriate to use a smaller icon and text depending on the available space.
