# Internationalization

Internationalization is the practice of adapting applications to various regions, languages, and cultures. You can accomplish this in your applications by considering the differences in language, scripts, and directionality.

## Showing Language Options

When showing a list of languages, you can decide whether you want to translate the language names or not (e.g., "English" vs. "InglÃ©s"). There are pros and cons to each approach, so consider what makes the most sense for your application. Providing other cues (such as an icon) to help users find the language selection can help.

## Translating the Text

To localize your application content, you should create a string resource file or object that contains the translations for any display text used in your application. You will not want to have any text hard-coded in your application's UI. To switch your application to another language, you simply toggle the file/object used to populate the UI to the appropriate translation.

## Converting Units, Currencies, and Number Formats

While this usually goes with the locale settings, certain users might have different preferences, and there can be variations even within the same locale. You should provide the user with default settings when they first load a locale, but allow the users change their preferences, and remember it the next time they login with that locale.

## Checking for Spacing

Different languages/writing systems may require different vertical and horizontal space. To ensure flexibility, avoid using fixed dimensions for necessary UI components such as buttons, labels, and badges. Also, consider setting different default display font sizes for languages that may have smaller glyphs.

> **NOTE:** PX Blue recommends using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) for all non-western languages. You can read more on our [Typography](/style/typography) page.

## Bi-directionality/Right-to-Left (RTL) Support

<MaterialDesignDescription

    description={'Learn about mirroring layout, mirroring elements, and localization.'}
    url={'https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html'}
/>

Some languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are read from right to left. Applications supporting these languages will need to mirror the UI so the natural flow is from right to left. For example, navigation drawers should be displayed on the right side of the screen, icons should be to the right of the text in buttons, and any icons with directionality should be mirrored.

<ImageGrid
    images={[UIFlippedImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: A PX Blue user interface in right-to-left language (English).',
        '2: The same PX Blue user interface in left-to-right language (Arabic).',
    ]}
/>
<ImageGrid
    images={[IconsFlippedImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: Icons that indicate directions should be mirrored.',
        '2: Icons with glyphs and symbols should never be mirrored.',
    ]}
/>

## Curtural differences

Sometimes certain UI elements convey different meaning in different cultures. For example, in America, the red color in the stock market indicates a decline, while in China the same color indicates a rise. A thumb-up gesture usually expresses an approval in English-speaking country, yet the gesture can have a negative meaning in Iraq. When designing for a new market, you are encouraged to have a local consultant run an audit for your application.

# Developers

There are a number of available libraries to assist with implementing internationalization in your applications.

## Angular

For projects that need the ability to swap between languages, we recommend using [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). As an alternative, the Angular framework has a powerful built-in [i18n tool](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) available, but it requires a separate web app be built for each supported language (e.g. an English version, a Spanish version, etc). This is ideal for larger projects that don't require in-app language switching and don't support more than a few locales.

## React and React Native

There are many JS libraries available to help internationalize your application. If you are already using PX Blue, [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/guides/localization/) has a lightweight solution available.
For heavier projects, we recommend using a third-party solution [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next).
