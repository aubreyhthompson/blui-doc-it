Internationalization and localization referes to a sequence of practices in adapting applications to various regions, languages, and cultures. You can accomplish this in your applications by considering the differences in language, scripts, and directionality.

Internationalization, sometimes abreviated as "I18N", refers to the process of designing and developing a generic base product, free of systematic biases in language and culture. Localization, sometimes written as "L10N", talks about adapting or customizing a product to some specific areas. Internationalization and localization are both crucial in making your application prosper in a global market.

# Changing Locales

## Translating the Text

To localize your application content, you should create a string resource file or object that contains the translations for any display text used in your application. You will not want to have any text hard-coded in your application's UI. To switch your application to another language, you simply toggle the file/object used to populate the UI to the appropriate translation.

## Showing Language Options

<ImageGrid images={[LanguageOptionsImage]} regularWidth />

Language options are typically offered in the user preference settings. In case when a user authorization is absent (such as an application available to everyone on-site, or a public-facing website), the language option is expected in the app bar or in the footer.

When showing a list of languages, you can decide whether you want to translate the language names or not (e.g., "English" vs. "Ingl√©s"). There are pros and cons to each approach, so consider what makes the most sense for your application. Providing other cues (such as an icon) to help users find the language selection can help.

## Converting Units, Currencies, and Formats

While this usually goes with the locale settings, certain users might have different preferences, and there can be variations even within the same locale. You should provide the user with default settings when they first load a locale, but allow the users change their preferences, and remember it the next time they log in with that locale.

## Checking for Spacing

<ImageGrid
    images={[ButtonWidthImage, TextFieldWidthImage]}
    caption={[
        '1: Buttons with different width.',
        '2: Error message in English.',
        '3: Same error message in Malayalam can result in line wrapping.',
    ]}
/>

Different languages/writing systems may require different vertical and horizontal space. To ensure flexibility, avoid using fixed dimensions for UI components such as buttons, labels, and badges. Also, consider setting different default display font sizes for languages that may have smaller glyphs.

> **NOTE:** PX Blue recommends using [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) for all non-western languages. You can read more on our [Typography](/style/typography) page.

## Bi-directionality/Right-to-Left (RTL) Support

    description={'Learn about mirroring layout, mirroring elements, and localization.'}
    url={'https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html'}
/>

Some languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are read from right to left. Applications supporting these languages will need to mirror the UI so the natural flow is from right to left. For example, navigation drawers should be displayed on the right side of the screen, icons should be to the right of the text in buttons, and any icons with directionality should be mirrored.

<ImageGrid
    images={[UIFlippedImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: A PX Blue user interface in right-to-left language (English).',
        '2: The same PX Blue user interface in left-to-right language (Arabic).',
    ]}
/>
<ImageGrid
    images={[IconsFlippedImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: Icons that indicate directions should be mirrored.',
        '2: Icons with glyphs and symbols should never be mirrored.',
    ]}
/>

## Cultural Differences

<ImageGrid
    images={[CulturalDifferencesImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={'People from different cultures are appealed to different things.'}
/>

Addressing the cultural differences is the key concern of the localization. Sometimes certain UI elements convey different meaning in different cultures. For example, in America, the red color in the stock market indicates a decline, while in China the same color indicates a rise. A thumb-up gesture usually expresses an approval in English-speaking country, yet the gesture can have a negative meaning in Iraq. When designing for a new market, you are encouraged to have a local consultant run an audit for your application.

When you are designing for webpages (instead of applications), your primary goal is to advertise your products and services, and appeal to the local market. The language tone, page style, and choice of image assets are expected to be tailored for different targeted culture. Likewise, your user study and market research conclusions derived under a certain cultural background might not apply to another culture.

# Developers

There are a number of available libraries to assist with implementing internationalization in your applications.

## Angular and Ionic

For projects that need the ability to swap between languages, we recommend using [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). As an alternative, the Angular framework has a powerful built-in [i18n tool](https://angular.io/guide/i18n) available, but it requires a separate web app be built for each supported language (e.g. an English version, a Spanish version, etc). This is ideal for larger projects that don't require in-app language switching and don't support more than a few locales.

## React

There are many JS libraries available to help internationalize your applications. We recommend using a third-party solution [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next).

## React Native

For mirroring the user interface, we recommend using [I18nManager](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2016/08/19/right-to-left-support-for-react-native-apps). To manage your translation string, we recommend [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).
