# Overlay Patterns

Overlays are useful for times when you want to block interaction with the page to display data or wait for user input. These elements can come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

## Modal Dialog
The modal dialog is your typical pop-up window. These are traditionally used when you need to confirm a user action (such as deleting an item). These usually appear in the center of the screen.

## Bottom Sheet
A bottom sheet is similar to a modal dialog, but slides in from the bottom of the screen. A dark overlay is usually used to block user interaction with the main app until the bottom sheet is closed.
 
This is a very common pattern in mobile applications, but can also be used in responsive web apps. Typically, the bottom sheet contains global actions for the entire page and is activated by a button in the app bar.

### Basic

<ImageGrid images={[BasicBottomsheet, BasicBottomsheetDesktop]} style={{marginBottom: 32}} caption={'On desktop view, the basic bottom sheet has a fixed width and is centered in the display area. '} />

<DemoCard repository={'bottomsheet'} angular react ionic reactNative float={'right'}/>

The basic bottom sheet simply contains a list of actions. The final "Cancel" action is used to dismiss the bottom sheet.

### Advanced

<ImageGrid images={[ComplexBottomsheet, ComplexBottomsheetDesktop]} style={{marginBottom: 32}} caption={'A Bottom Sheet can use some complex componnets for advanced functionalities, e.g., a filter.'} />

<DemoCard repository={'complex-bottomsheet'} angular react ionic reactNative float={'right'}/>

A Bottom Sheet is essentially just a container with some attached behaviors. Though it typically contains a simple list, it can be customized to include any content that is required for your application. For example, it can be used for custom sort/filter functionality (seen in the example below), biometric authentication prompts, etc.
