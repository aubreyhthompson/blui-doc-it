# Overlays

Overlays are useful in a variety of situations when you need to provide more context or information to a user than can be found in your primary content. For example, they can be used to present a confirmation dialog, details about a selected item, or actions that can be taken on a page. These can be used for presenting information (such as with a dialog) or capturing it (such as in a form).

# Variations

Overlay elements come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their purpose and can be either blocking (i.e., the user must interact with the overlay before they can do anything else) or non-blocking.

## Modal Dialog

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Dialogs'} url={'https://material.io/components/dialogs/'} />

The modal dialog is your typical pop-up window that appears in the center of the screen in front of primary content. The primary use of dialogs is to present critical information to users or to ask for a decision. For example, you may wish to ask a user if they are sure they want to delete a file.

Modals are also great for presenting single tasks or workflows to a user. By using a modal, you allow the user to do more work without cluttering your main layout with unnecessary information (e.g., an Add User button could open a modal with a form to enter the new user's information). You can also use modals to edit large amounts of information that would be too difficult to fit into a sidebar.

Modal dialogs are always blocking â€” they must be dismissed before the user can interact with the rest of the application content. They may be dismissed by clicking on a close button or, for less critical dialogs, by clicking anywhere on the screen outside of it.

## Sidebar

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: Side'} url={'https://material.io/components/sheets-side'} />

Sidebars (Side Sheets in the Material documentation) are used to present supplemental information to users. Most commonly, they display information about selected items in the main interface (e.g., selecting an item in a list would open a sidebar on the right with additional details about the selected item).

They can also present simple form data and inputs (such as radio buttons, checkbox, dropdown menus, etc.) for editing a selected item. This type of sidebar should be temporary such that the user can easily close it with a close button or clicking elsewhere on the screen.

Sidebars should always appear on the opposite side of the screen as the main [navigation](/patterns/navigation).

> In general, modals should be used when creating new data, and sidebars should be used for viewing and editing existing data.

## Bottom Sheet

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: Bottom'} url={'https://material.io/components/sheets-bottom/'} />

Bottom sheets are content surfaces that slide in from the bottom of the screen, primarily used in mobile applications. There are three types: standard, modal, and expandable. The content shown in a bottom sheet can be as simple as a list of items or as complex as a full screen layout.

### Standard

A standard bottom sheet is always visible and non-blocking, used most commonly for multitasking, such as displaying media player controls while browsing other content.

### Modal

Modal bottom sheets are similar to modal dialogs that open from the bottom of the screen and block interaction with the rest of the application. These typically contain a list of options or actions and are usually activated via a action button in the [app bar](/patterns/appbar). This is the most common type of bottom sheet found in PX Blue applications.

### Expanding

Expanding bottom sheets first appear in a smaller form factor, but can be expanded to take up more of the screen and display additional content.
