# Overlays

<ImageGrid images={[Banner]} regularWidth />

Overlays are content that appears on top of other content. They can be used to display information, or capture it.

<Divider />

# Common Use Cases

Overlays are useful in a variety of situations. They can be used to supplement the information found in your primary content or to capture input from a user. For example, they can be used to present a confirmation dialog, details about a selected item, or actions that can be taken on a page.

The most common overlays in PX Blue applications are:

-   Confirmation dialogs
-   Information sidebars
-   Navigation menus
-   Add / Edit dialogs

<Divider />

# Variations

Overlay elements come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their purpose and can be either blocking (i.e., the user must interact with the overlay before they can do anything else) or non-blocking.

## Modal Dialog

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[SimpleDialog]}
        caption={'A typical use case for a modal dialog — session expiration warning.'}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'Dialogs'} url={'https://material.io/components/dialogs/'} />
</React.Fragment>

The modal dialog appears in the center of the screen in front of the primary content. They present critical information to users or ask them to make a decision, such as confirming the deletion of an item.

Simple modals should have a title, a descriptive message, and action buttons for users to respond to the prompt or dismiss the dialog. These modals should be no larger than is necessary to contain their contents.

Modals are also great for presenting single-screen tasks to user, such as changing a password.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[DialogTask]}
        caption={[
            'A modal dialog can present a single-screen workflow, such as changing a password.',
            '1. On desktop, this can be presented as a modal.',
            '2. In mobile applications, modal dialogs should be used primarily for notifications and confirmations. Single-screen tasks or workflows are better presented as separate screens or full-screen bottom sheets.',
        ]}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Forms'}
        url={'/patterns/forms'}
        description={`When using form content in an overlay, be sure to follow PX Blue's guidelines for forms.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
</React.Fragment>

Modal dialogs are always blocking — they must be dismissed before the user can interact with the rest of the application content, typically by clicking a dismiss / close button or by clicking elsewhere on the screen.

> If you are collecting a lot of information, it may be better to move this form to a separate page in your application rather than trying to place too much content into a modal.

## Sidebar

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[SidePanel]}
        caption={'Sidebars can be used to show additional information about a selected item.'}
    />
    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: Side'} url={'https://material.io/components/sheets-side'} />
</React.Fragment>

Sidebars (Side Sheets in the Material documentation) are used to present supplemental information to users. Most commonly, they display information about a selected item in the main interface (e.g., selecting an item in a list would open a sidebar on the right with additional details about the selected item). However, they can also be used as permanent UI elements, such as the legend for a chart or map.

<ImageGrid regularWidth images={[TrendLegend]} caption={'A permanent sidebar can be used for chart / map legends.'} />

They can also present simple form data and inputs, such as radio buttons, checkbox, dropdown menus, etc. for editing a selected item. This type of sidebar should be dismissible, such that the user can easily close it with a close button or clicking elsewhere on the screen.

Sidebars should always appear on the opposite side of the screen as the main [navigation](/patterns/navigation).

> In general, modals should be used when creating new data, and sidebars should be used for viewing and editing existing data.

## Bottom Sheet

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: Bottom'} url={'https://material.io/components/sheets-bottom/'} />

Bottom sheets are content surfaces that slide in from the bottom of the screen, primarily used in mobile applications. There are three types: standard, modal, and expandable, but the one used most often in PX Blue applications is the modal bottom sheet.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        regularWidth
        images={[SimpleBottomsheet]}
        caption={[
            '1. On mobile, the modal bottom sheet takes up the full width of the screen.',
            '2. On desktop, bottom sheets can usually be replaced by a contextual menu instead.',
        ]}
    />
    <DemoCard
        repository={'bottomsheet'}
        angular={
            'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Foverlays%2Fbasic-bottom-sheet%2Fbasic-bottom-sheet.component.ts#'
        }
        react={
            'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/overlays/basic-bottom-sheet/index.tsx&initialpath=basic-bottom-sheet#'
        }
        ionic={
            'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/ionic-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Foverlays%2Fbasic-bottom-sheet%2Fbasic-bottom-sheet.component.ts#'
        }
        reactNative
    />
    <DemoCard
        repository={'complex-bottomsheet'}
        angular={
            'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Foverlays%2Fcomplex-bottom-sheet%2Fcomplex-bottom-sheet.component.ts#'
        }
        react={
            'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/overlays/complex-bottom-sheet/index.tsx&initialpath=complex-bottom-sheet#'
        }
        ionic={
            'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/ionic-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Foverlays%2Fcomplex-bottom-sheet%2Fcomplex-bottom-sheet.component.ts#'
        }
        reactNative
    />
</React.Fragment>

Modal bottom sheets block interaction with the rest of the application. These typically contain a list of options or actions and are usually activated via an action button in the [app bar](/patterns/appbar).

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription
        title={'Lists'}
        url={'/patterns/lists'}
        description={`When using lists in an overlay / bottom sheet, be sure to follow PX Blue's guidelines for lists.`}
        avatar={<PxblueSmallAltIcon style={{ width: 48, height: 48 }} />}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>
