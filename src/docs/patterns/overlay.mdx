# Overlay Patterns

Overlays are useful for times when you want to block interaction with the page to display data or wait for user input. These elements can come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

## Modal Dialog

The modal dialog is your typical pop-up window. These are traditionally used when you need to confirm a user action (such as deleting an item). These usually appear in the center of the screen.

<MaterialDesignDescription
    title={'Dialogs'}
    url={'https://material.io/components/dialogs/'}
    description={'Read more about dialogs on Material.io.'}
/>

## Bottom Sheet

A bottom sheet is similar to a modal dialog, but slides in from the bottom of the screen. A dark overlay is usually used to block user interaction with the main app until the bottom sheet is closed.

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Sheets: bottom'} url={'https://material.io/components/sheets-bottom/'} />

This is a very common pattern in mobile applications, but can also be used in responsive web apps. Typically, the bottom sheet contains global actions for the entire page and is activated by a button in the app bar.

### Basic

<ImageGrid images={[BasicBottomsheet, ComplexBottomsheet]} caption={'A Bottom Sheet can be simple or complex.'} />
<DemoCard repository={'bottomsheet'} angular react ionic reactNative float={'right'} />

The basic bottom sheet simply contains a list of actions. The final "Cancel" action is used to dismiss the bottom sheet.

### Advanced

<DemoCard repository={'complex-bottomsheet'} angular react ionic reactNative float={'right'} />

A bottom sheet is essentially just a container with some attached behaviors. Though it typically contains a simple list, it can be customized to include any content that is required for your application. For example, it can be used for custom sort/filter functionality (seen in the example below), biometric authentication prompts, etc.
