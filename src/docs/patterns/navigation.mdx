# Navigation

<ImageGrid images={navigation-banner]} regularWidth />

Navigation is the way in which users are able to access the different parts of your application.

Main navigation is typically accomplished through a side drawer navigation panel with a list of links to the various pages in your application. PX Blue applications can have individual page or feature navigation as well. This can be accomplished by the use of tabs that can run across the top of your application.

Keep in mind that these navigation patterns are tailored for PX Blue application use. PX Blue will be introducing traditional website navigation patterns in the near future.

# Drawer Navigation

The most basic navigation panel is fixed in place and always visible on the left side of the application The navigation can be a Rail or a Permanent Drawer that is open and revealing multiple navigation options. Other forms include Persistent, Temporary and Collapsible Navigation.

## Permanent

Permanent Navigation refers to a navigation drawer that is set to open with no option too close. The drawer can adopt the same elevation as the header or the elevation can be replaced with a 1px stroke.

<ImageGrid images={[navigation-permanent]} regularWidth />

## Persistant

Persistant Navigation refers to a navigation rail that is always visible while navigating throughout the application. The rail can use any of the patterns defined by PX Blue.

<ImageGrid images={[navigation-persistant]} regularWidth />

## Temporary

Temporary Navigation refers to an open navigation drawer. The drawer only appears when the user takes a direct action to open it. The drawer reverts to it's closed state when the user takes a direct action to close it.

<ImageGrid images={[navigation-temporary]} regularWidth />

## Rail

Rails should be used for top-level destinations that need to be accessible anywhere in an app. It is recommended to keep no more than seven main destinations in a product. Rails are best used in tablet and desktop applications that need to show large amounts of data or additional space to complete complex tasks.

<ImageGrid images={[navigation-rail]} regularWidth />

## Collapsible

A more common implementation of the navigation panel is a collapsible panel that can be opened and closed via the menu icon in the top left corner of the application. This implementation can have two different variations: content-resize or content-cover.

<ImageGrid 
    images={[collapsible]} 
    caption={
        'Figure 1 displays the normal collapsed state of the menu.
         Figure 2 displays the open state of the menu..'
    }
regularWidth />

## Icon Navigation Bar / Responsive Navigation

<ImageGrid
    images={[PersistentImg, PermanentImg]}
    caption={
        'When the user hovers on the Navigation Rail, the side navigation will expand temporarily, revealing the text details of each navigation item; when the user moves their cursor away, the whole side navigation panel collapses.'
    }
/>

<DemoCard
    repository={'icon-navigation'}
    angular={'https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/components-drawer--within-a-drawer-layout'}
    react={'https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/story/components-drawer--in-drawer-layout'}
/>

### Behavior

The icon navigation bar (a.k.a. "[navigation rail](https://material.io/components/navigation-rail/#anatomy)" on Material.io) is a minimalist approach to the navigation panel. It features a single icon to represent each of the main areas of the application. This navigation panel is typically used on larger screens only, and is expandable to a full side navigation panel on hover or when clicking the menu icon.

These may be used in conjunction with Bottom Tab navigation - on larger resolution displays, bottom tabs would become elements in the side navigation.

# Tab Navigation

Tabs help apps organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related. A common use case for this pattern are Settings pages.

<ImageGrid images={[navigation-tabs]} regularWidth />

# Common Use Cases

You can refer to the Material Design Navigation guidelines for general usage instructions.

Navigation drawers are recommended for:

- Apps with five or more top-level destinations
- Apps with two or more levels of navigation hierarchy
- Quick navigation between unrelated destinations

Rails are recommended for:

- Top-level destinations that need to be accessible anywhere in an app
- Applications that have no more than seven destinations
- Tablet or desktop layouts
- Apps that require more space to preform tasks or display information

# Variations

<ImageGrid images={[anatomy]} regularWidth />

## Nested Navigation Items

You can nest multiple layers of navigation options in the Navigation Menu. It is recommended not to exceed two levels of nested navigation. 

<ImageGrid images={[nested-item, nested-item-standards]} regularWidth />

## Content-Cover

In this implementation, the navigation panel slides out from the side, partially obscuring the main content of the application. It is often implemented with a dark overlay that blocks the main application and directs the user's focus to the navigation panel that was opened. This pattern is more common on smaller devices such as tablets and mobile applications. 

<ImageGrid 
    images={[content-cover-desktop
    caption={
        'Figure 1 displays the normal collapsed state of the menu for desktop.
         Figure 2 displays the open state of the menu with a gray overlay.'
    ,content-cover-tablet]} 
    caption={
        'Figure 1 displays the normal collapsed state of the menu for tablet.
         Figure 2 displays the open state of the menu with a gray overlay.'
    }
regularWidth />

<!-- @TODO switch side-navigation links over to the "Component Recommendations style" instead of a "Interactive Code example" once we have one designed. -->

<DemoCard
    repository={'side-navigation'}
    angular={'https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular/?path=/story/components-drawer--with-full-config'}
    react
/>

## Dividers

Dividers find the most usage in the Collapsible Navigation pattern. The reason for this is to help distinguish the clickable areas for the icons (collapsed state). In General avoid adding divider lines in random areas. However, there are some exceptions to the rules. For example, Footer, section header and nested nav items can use dividers to help break the content out from the rest of the list.

<ImageGrid images={[divider]} regularWidth />

## Footer Behavior

PX Blue recommends the use of a pinned footer in the navigation panel on all panel variations. An exception to this rule is if there is an extremely large menu structure. Exceptions can also be made if the product is using an expended header that is displaying a logo.
