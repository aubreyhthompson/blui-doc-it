# Lists

<ImageGrid images={[ListBannerImage]} regularWidth />

Lists are frequently used throughout PX Blue applications. Typically, lists are used to represent groups of similar data. They can be used to show simple name-value pairs in a sidebar all the way to complex timelines or device lists.

<React.Fragment>
    <MaterialDesignDescription title={'Lists'} url={'https://material.io/components/lists/'} />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Common Use Cases

<ImageGrid
    images={[
        NotificationListDesktopImage,
        NotificationListMobileImage,
        DashboardListDesktopImage,
        DashboardListMobileImage,
    ]}
    caption={[
        'Notifications and status list are the two most common use case for the list pattern.',
        '1&2: Notifications, for mobile and desktop respectively.',
        '3&4: A status list embedded inside a dashboard, for mobile and desktop respectively.',
    ]}
/>

The scenarios in which a lists may occur includes:

-   Dashboard / current status
-   Notifications
-   Inventories, list of assets
-   Contacts
-   File tree
-   Logs

Lists should **NOT** be used for:

-   Where there are no comparable data presents
-   Where [data visualization](/patterns/visualizations) can be more effective (where dashboard heros can be better to highlight information)
-   \[Questionable\] Pages with more than 2 lists that user have to constantly go back and forth (rather than browse through it)

Lists usually reside in some larger structures, such as a panel (mobile) or in a card (desktop). Or if the list is the only element, by itself.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[AnatomyImage]}
        regularWidth
        caption={[
            '1: Panel header and footer.',
            '2: A global list action, in this case it sits inside the panel header.',
            '3: Some panel modules, providing supporting information or additional interactions to the list.',
            '4: A list item.',
            '5: A local list action.',
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Variations

There are several list item variations

-   Basic list
-   Display status
-   Display time stamps
-   Inset / Full dividers
-   Make it a table

## Basic Lists

<ImageGrid
    images={[SimpleListImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: Lists can be as simple as data-value pairs.',
        '2: You may add avatars to distinguish each list elements.',
    ]}
/>
<DemoCard
    repository={'data-list'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fdata-list%2Fdata-list.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/data-list/index.tsx&initialpath=data-list'
    }
    ionic
    reactNative
/>

The simplest type of list simply presents a single line (or multiple lines) of text for each element in the collection.

## Lists with Status

<ImageGrid images={[StatusListImage]} regularWidth caption={`Use an icon avatar and / or a status stripe to catch people's attention.`}/>
<DemoCard repository={'status-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fstatus-list%2Fstatus-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/status-list/index.tsx&initialpath=status-list'} ionic reactNative/>

Commonly in PX Blue applications, list items also show some visual indication of the item's current status (such as online, offline, or an error condition). This is achieved by using status / type icons (i.e., avatars) and sometimes a status stripe.

<ImageGrid
    images={[IconAlignImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={
        'Whenever you have a list with potentially avatar-ed icons, make sure all the icons are center-aligned. Otherwise, everything should be left-aligned.'
    }
/>

In the rare case where you need to display a status but cannot fit in neither an avatar nor a status stripe, such as the mini-list inside a [scorecard component](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-score-card--get-read-me-story), you may color code your list item icons and labels. However, for accessibility concerns, you should never rely _solely_ on the color to convey the message.

<ImageGrid
    images={[ScorecardImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        'A scorecard with a mini-list in the card body.',
        `1: In addition to the change of color for the icon, you can also change icons, make label text descriptive, and bolden the font.`,
    ]}
/>

## Time stamps

Many UI elements can be added to the list items, and one of the most common such elements is a timestamp, usually occurs in device logs and list of notifications. You are encouraged to group your list items by dates for readability.

<ImageGrid
    images={[NotificationBucketsImage1, NotificationBucketsImage2]}
    caption={[
        'You may organically group your lists into buckets.',
        '1: "Today - Yesterday - Earlier This Week" buckets',
        '2: Plain date buckets. Note the dates have been taken out of the individual list items to avoid redundancy.',
    ]}
/>

## Data Table

# Behaviors

-   On hover / on click
    -   Display hover state, and ripple if there is a list-wide interaction
-   Global List Actions
    -   Toggle between different lists
    -   Filter
    -   Drag & Drop
-   Local List Actions
    -   Avoid makign list itself clickable & some other list action clickable at the same time
    -   Navigation (see also drawers) / View more details
    -   Inline value change in data table
    -   View more details
-   Checkbox
    -   Highlight background?
-   Responsiveness
    -   Avoid using table unless you have to
    -   mobile lists may display less things but should have same kind of list actions as desktop lists

<DemoCard
    repository={'action-list'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Faction-list%2Faction-list.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/action-list/index.tsx&initialpath=action-list'
    }
    ionic
    reactNative
/>

If there are actions that you would like to perform on individual list items, these can be included via icons or a 3-dot action menu (multiple actions) on each list item. Depending on the space available, you typically will want to use the action menu if you have more than three actions that can be taken. Global actions that affect the whole list (such as Add or Clear) should be placed in the list header.

## Lists with Actions

<ImageGrid images={[Image3, Image4, Image5]} />

## Actions on Selected Items

This is global actions?

<ImageGrid images={[Image6]} />
<DemoCard repository={'multiselect-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fmultiselect-list%2Fmultiselect-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/multiselect-list/index.tsx&initialpath=multiselect-list'} ionic reactNative />

You may want to take action on several list items at once, but not all. These should be presented in a persistent snackbar (similar to a [bottom sheet](/patterns/overlay)) after selecting items. Selection can be handled in several ways, the simplest of which is to include a checkbox for each list item.

## Drag and Drop

Global actions

<ImageGrid images={[Image7, Image8]} />
<DemoCard repository={'sortable-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fsortable-list%2Fsortable-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/sortable-list/index.tsx&initialpath=sortable-list'} ionic reactNative />

Occasionally, you may want users to be able to re-order the items in a list manually. This should be accomplished by placing a drag handle as the leftmost element in the row. The ability to re-order the list should be locked behind an Edit Mode toggle mechanism.

## Tables

<DemoCard
    repository={'responsive-table'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fresponsive-table%2Fresponsive-table.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/responsive-table/index.tsx&initialpath=responsive-table'
    }
/>

Tables are similar to lists but are slightly more structured by ordering data for a list item into columns. These work well on larger screens, but at a mobile size, they should collapse into a list for better formatting.

Lists emphasize on each individual items, while tables highlights the comparison between each individual data points.

Tables are more "data visualisable".
