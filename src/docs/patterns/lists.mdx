# Lists & Tables

<ImageGrid images={[ListBannerImage]} regularWidth />

Lists and tables are frequently used throughout PX Blue applications. Typically, lists are used to represent groups of similar data. They can display simple name-value pairs in a sidebar all the way to complex timelines or device lists.

<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Lists'} url={'https://material.io/components/lists/'} />

# Common Use Cases

<ImageGrid
    images={[
        NotificationListDesktopImage,
        NotificationListMobileImage,
        DashboardListDesktopImage,
        DashboardListMobileImage,
    ]}
    caption={[
        'Notifications and status list are the two most common use case for the list pattern.',
        '1&2: Notifications, for mobile and desktop respectively.',
        '3&4: A status list embedded inside a dashboard, for mobile and desktop respectively.',
    ]}
/>

The scenarios in which a lists may occur include:

-   Dashboard / current status
-   Notifications
-   Inventories, list of assets
-   Contacts
-   File tree
-   Logs
-   Settings

Lists should **NOT** be used where:

-   There are no comparable data presents, such as a data set with totally different structure;
-   The users demand a summary rather than detailed data value, such as on the home screen. Use [Data visualization](/patterns/visualizations) to display trends, or [heroes](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-hero--get-read-me-story) to display a summary.

Lists usually reside in some larger structures, such as a panel (mobile) or in a card (desktop).

Or if the list is the only element, by itself.

<React.Fragment>
    <ImageGrid
        images={[AnatomyImage]}
        regularWidth
        caption={[
            'An example of a list embedded inside a panel.',
            '1: Panel header and footer.',
            '2: A global list action, in this case it sits inside the panel header.',
            '3: Some panel modules, providing supporting information or additional interactions to the list.',
            '4: A list item.',
            '5: A local list action.',
        ]}
    />
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Variations

## Basic Lists

<ImageGrid
    images={[SimpleListImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        '1: Lists can be as simple as data-value pairs.',
        '2: You may add avatars to distinguish each list elements.',
    ]}
/>
<DemoCard
    repository={'data-list'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fdata-list%2Fdata-list.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/data-list/index.tsx&initialpath=data-list'
    }
    ionic
    reactNative
/>

The simplest type of list simply presents a single line (or multiple lines) of text for each element in the collection.

## Lists with Status

<ImageGrid images={[StatusListImage]} regularWidth caption={`Use an icon avatar and / or a status stripe to catch people's attention.`}/>
<DemoCard repository={'status-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fstatus-list%2Fstatus-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/status-list/index.tsx&initialpath=status-list'} ionic reactNative/>

Commonly in PX Blue applications, list items also show some visual indication of the item's current status, such as online, offline, or an error condition. This is achieved by using avatars and status stripes.

<ImageGrid
    images={[IconAlignImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={
        'Whenever you have a list with potentially avatars, make sure all the icons, with or without avatars, are center-aligned. Otherwise, all icons should be left-aligned.'
    }
/>

In the rare case where you need to display a status but cannot fit in neither an avatar nor a status stripe, such as the mini-list inside a [scorecard component](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react/?path=/info/components-score-card--get-read-me-story), you may color code your list item icons and labels. However, for accessibility concerns, you should never rely _solely_ on the color to convey the message.

<ImageGrid
    images={[ScorecardImage]}
    regularWidth
    caption={[
        'A scorecard with a mini-list in the card body.',
        `1: In addition to the change of color for the icon, you can also change icons, make label text descriptive, and bolden the font.`,
    ]}
/>

## Timestamps

Many UI elements can be added to the list items, and one of the most common such elements is a timestamp, which usually occurs in device logs and list of notifications. You are encouraged to group your list items by dates for readability.

<ImageGrid
    images={[NotificationBucketsImage1, NotificationBucketsImage2]}
    caption={[
        'You may organically group your lists into buckets.',
        '1: "Today - Yesterday - Earlier This Week" buckets',
        '2: Plain date buckets. Note the dates have been taken out of the individual list items to avoid redundancy.',
    ]}
/>

## Tables

<!-- Might be enhanced when we go to do the "design a better table" story -->

<DemoCard
    repository={'responsive-table'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fresponsive-table%2Fresponsive-table.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/responsive-table/index.tsx&initialpath=responsive-table'
    }
/>
<MaterialDesignDescription title={'Data Tables'} url={'https://material.io/components/data-tables/'} />

Lists emphasize on each individual items, while tables highlights the comparison between each individual data points. However, tables generally perform poorly on a mobile device. Do not structure the list as a table if your users don't examine the data "vertically".

<React.Fragment>
    <Divider />
</React.Fragment>

# Behaviors

Lists can be interactive. In general, there are two types of interactions: global list actions and local list actions.

<DemoCard
    repository={'action-list'}
    angular={
        'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Faction-list%2Faction-list.component.ts'
    }
    react={
        'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/action-list/index.tsx&initialpath=action-list'
    }
    ionic
    reactNative
/>

## Global List Actions

Global list actions are the actions that manipulate the entire list, rather than treating each list item individually. The buttons typically sit in the [Appbar](/patterns/appbar), the panel header, or a button row (desktop-only).

<ImageGrid
    images={[GlobalActionAppBarImage, GlobalActionPanelHeaderImage, GlobalActionAsButtonImage]}
    caption={[
        `1: Global actions in the Appbar.`,
        '2: Global actions in the panel header.',
        '3: Global actions in its own button row.',
    ]}
/>

Common global list actions include:

-   Adding a new list item
-   Sorting and filtering the list
-   Toggling a different view, such as a grid view
-   Exporting or downloading the list data

### Drag and Drop

<ImageGrid images={[SortableListImage]} regularWidth />
<DemoCard repository={'sortable-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fsortable-list%2Fsortable-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/sortable-list/index.tsx&initialpath=sortable-list'} ionic reactNative />

Drag and drop is a special case for list sorting. It re-orders the items in a list manually. This should be accomplished by placing a drag handle as the leftmost element in the row. The ability to re-order the list should be locked behind an Edit Mode toggle mechanism.

## Local List Actions

<ImageGrid
    images={[LocalListActionsImage]}
    caption={[
        '1: A more_vert icon, used to open a menu for more list actions.',
        '2: A chevron, usually opens up a new page with list item details.',
        '3: A few icons that serve as list action buttons.',
        '4: List actions can be used together.',
        '5: An inline checkbox to toggle a status.',
        '6: An inline text field for data entry.',
    ]}
    gridImageProps={{ sm: 8 }}
/>

If there are actions that you would like to perform on individual list items, you may add interactive elements such as icons or a 3-dot action menu. Depending on the space available, you typically will want to use the action menu if you have more than three actions that can be taken.

> If your list item is clickable for the entire item, then you should not arrange any extra local list actions, as the two interactions can intervene with each other.

### Navigating Down a Tree Structure

<ImageGrid
    images={[NavigateListImage]}
    caption={['1: A list used for separated pages.', '2: A list displaying a folder structure.']}
    regularWidth
/>

Lists can be used to navigate a tree-like structure in an application. See [the navigation pattern](/patterns/navigation).

### Actions on Selected Items

<ImageGrid images={[MultiSelectImage]} regularWidth />
<DemoCard repository={'multiselect-list'} angular={'https://stackblitz.com/github/pxblue/angular-design-patterns?file=src%2Fapp%2Fpages%2Flist%2Fmultiselect-list%2Fmultiselect-list.component.ts'} react={'https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns/tree/master?file=/src/pages/lists/multiselect-list/index.tsx&initialpath=multiselect-list'} ionic reactNative />

You may want to take action on several list items at once, but not all. The easiest way to do this is through a multi-select list. You may optionally add a highlight color for the selected items.

## Responsive Design

When it comes to responsive design and progressive disclosure, it can be tricky to fit all the information from a list onto a smaller screen. Here are some best practices on designing for mobile phone:

-   If a list item has too many elements in it and doesn't fit, try converting the item into a summary card, with a "view more" option to view the full data.
-   Avoid using tables.
-   Try adding gestures (long-press, swipe-left) that fits with the phone's OS ecosystem.
