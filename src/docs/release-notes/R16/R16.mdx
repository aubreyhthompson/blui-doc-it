### Component Libraries

-   Added new components to our [Angular](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular) and [React Native](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native) component libraries:
    -   For Angular, we now have components for [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-drawer--readme), [ListItemTag](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-list-item-tag--readme), [Spacer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-spacer--readme),
        [Scorecard](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-score-card--readme), and [InfoListItem](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/angular/?path=/info/components-info-list-item--readme).
    -   For React Native, we now have a [Drawer](https://brightlayer-ui-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--drawer) component.
-   Enhanced style override capabilities on all of our React and React Native components
-   Adopted [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) as our official Material component library for React Native projects

### Reusable Workflows

We're excited to announce the availability of our first re-usable workflow: a reusable [Authentication Workflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-auth-workflow) for React Native apps. This workflow allows teams to use a common implementation for login & registration across different projects (just hook it up to your API).

### Design Patterns

-   Migrated React design patterns into a [single repository](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/brightlayer-ui/react-design-patterns).
-   Angular, React Native, and Ionic design patterns will be migrated in an upcoming release.

### Brightlayer UI CLI

The first version of the [Brightlayer UI CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli) is now available. This tool allows you to generate new Angular, Ionic, React, or React Native projects pre-loaded with Brightlayer UI components and themes, with no manual configuration required.

### Miscellaneous

-   Added search capability to documentation site
-   [Sticker Sheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/852558784352181868) published to the Figma Community
-   Bug fixes and improvements
