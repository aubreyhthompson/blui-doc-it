### New Components

We have added new components to our [Angular](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular) and [React Native](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react-native) component libraries:

-   For Angular, we now have components for [Drawer](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular-dev/?path=/info/components-drawer--readme), [ListItemTag](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular-dev/?path=/info/components-list-item-tag--readme), [Spacer](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular-dev/?path=/info/components-spacer--readme), and
    [Scorecard](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular-dev/?path=/info/components-score-card--readme), and [InfoListItem](https://pxblue-components.github.io/angular-dev/?path=/info/components-info-list-item--readme).
-   For React Native, we now have a [Drawer](https://pxblue-components.github.io/react-native/?path=/info/components-documentation--drawer) component.

### Reusable Workflows

We have finished innersourcing a reusable [Authentication Workflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/react-native-auth-workflow) for React Native apps, allowing teams to use a common implementation across different projects.

### Design Resources

Published our stickersheet to the Figma community

### Design Patterns

We have migrated a majority of our React design patterns into a [single repository](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pxblue/react-design-patterns).  Angular and React Native design patterns will be migrated into their own repos in R17.
